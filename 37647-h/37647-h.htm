<h2><a id="CHAPTER_I" ></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>A YOUNG FAKIR.</i></p>

<p>"I'm going to try it. Deacon Jones says I can
have the right to run both things for ten dollars,
and Uncle Nathan is going to lend me money
enough to get the stock."</p>

<p>"What scheme have you got in your head now,
Teddy Hargreaves?" and Mrs. Fernald looked over
her spectacles at the son of her widowed sister, who
was literally breathless in his excitement.</p>

<p>"I'm going to run a cane an' knife board at the
Peach Bottom fair, and try to make money enough
to pay the debt mother owes on the place."</p>

<p>"You're crazy&mdash;mad as a March hare! The idea
of a child like you setting yourself up to earn three<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
or four hundred dollars, when your father worked
all his life and couldn't get so much together."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fernald really appeared to be angry, and she
really believed there was good cause why she
should lose her temper. The thought that little
Teddy&mdash;a "whiflet" she called him&mdash;should set up
his opinion in such matters against his elders, and
attempt to earn in one season an amount which
Seth Hargreaves had never been able to repay during
his thirty-six years of life, was so preposterous
that the good lady looked upon the boy's assertion
as positive proof that he was not only ready but
willing to "fly in the face of Providence."</p>

<p>"I shall try it all the same," Teddy replied in a
most provokingly matter-of-fact tone, "an' I'm going
down to see Uncle Nathan this very minute."</p>

<p>"Very well, and I consider it my bounden duty
to advise your mother to keep you in the house until
the fair is ended," Aunt Sarah said, as she took
from its peg the well-worn gingham sun-bonnet.</p>

<p>Teddy had no desire to prolong the conversation,
which had been begun simply because his aunt insisted
on knowing where he had been, but hurried
away from the gate on which he had been swinging
while Mrs. Fernald questioned him, as if fearful
lest she might try to detain him until the matter
could be settled according to her own ideas of propriety.</p>

<p>"I can have the right to run what I want to,<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
every day the fair lasts, for ten dollars, an' now, if
you lend me fifteen, I'll be all right," the boy cried
as he burst into Nathan Hargreaves' store, just as
the old gentleman was adding a trifle more sand to
the sugar, in order to compensate for what might
possibly have been spilled by the careless clerk.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's fixed, eh? And you're really goin' to
turn fakir?" Uncle Nathan asked, wrinkling his
face into the semblance of a laugh, but remaining
silent, as if fearing to waste even such a cheap
thing as mirth.</p>

<p>"What's a fakir?"</p>

<p>"A man, or a boy, for that matter, who goes out
to sell things as you count on doin', if I'm fool
enough to let you throw away fifteen good dollars
of mine."</p>

<p>"But you promised to lend me the money."</p>

<p>"An' I'm going to do it; but that don't make me
any less a fool jest because I'm holdin' to my word.
Tell me what you count on doin', an' then we'll
come down to the business end of the scheme."</p>

<p>"I'll pay the ten dollars I've got to Deacon Jones
for the right to run the games, an' with what you
lend me I'm goin' to Waterville an' buy a whole lot
of knives an' canes. There's a storekeeper over
there who promises to sell that kind of goods for
less than they cost him."</p>

<p>"An' he's lyin' when he says it. People don't do
business for the fun of it; but that's neither here<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
nor there so far as our trade is concerned. I'm goin'
to give you the fifteen dollars now&mdash;it's a power of
money for a boy of your size, Teddy&mdash;, an' if you
make anything, as I allow you will, I'm to have
eighteen dollars back; don't forget that part of the
trade."</p>

<p>"I'll stand to what I agreed, Uncle Nathan, and
you shall be paid the very day the fair closes."</p>

<p>"Here it is," and with a sigh which was almost a
groan Uncle Nathan took from a fat calfskin wallet
three five-dollar bills, adding, as he handed
them to Teddy: "Be careful of it, my boy, for I'm
puttin' almost too much confidence in a child of
your size, an' nobody knows how distressed I'd be
if anything happened to prevent your paying it
back."</p>

<p>Teddy placed the money carefully in the inside
pocket of his vest, and, after promising for at least
the hundredth time that it should be repaid by the
close of the following week, hurried home confident
in the belief that he was on an extremely short
road to wealth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hargreaves was by no means as sanguine as
her son concerning the success of the scheme, and
actually appeared frightened when Teddy showed
her the money he had received from his Uncle
Nathan, who was reputed to be the "closest-fisted"
merchant to be found within a day's ride of Peach
Bottom Run.<span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>

<p>"If you should lose it, Teddy, and be unable to
pay him back at the exact time you promised, it
would be the undoing of us, for we could never expect
to get another dollar. I know he is not generous,
but have always believed that if we should be
in yet more straitened circumstances he would
give us some assistance. He has neither charity
nor mercy for any one who does not pay a little
more than his just debts&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I shall give back every cent of this, mother,
so don't look as if you were in such distress. I want
to go to Waterville to buy my stock in the morning,
an' am counting on walking. It's only seven
miles, an' I'll save fifty cents by traveling on
shanks' mare."</p>

<p>"I will have breakfast ready by four o'clock; but
you must come back on the stage, Teddy."</p>

<p>"Yes, if I feel very tired; but I don't know of
any easier way to earn a dollar than by walking
both ways."</p>

<p>The young "fakir" believed he knew exactly
what kind and amount of stock he wished to purchase
on the following day, therefore he had no
preparations to make for the journey save to get
his limbs in the best possible condition for the
tramp by retiring very early, in order to "scoop in"
plenty of sleep.</p>

<p>The thought of the success which should attend
him in his new venture kept his eyes open a long<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
while after getting into bed, and when he finally
succeeded in crossing over to the land of Nod,
dreams of the fortune to be made during the coming
week visited his brain, and remained there until
his mother's voice summoned him to breakfast.</p>

<p>The sun had not yet come up from behind the
hills when he was trudging sturdily along over the
dusty road, carrying a generous luncheon tied in a
snowy-white napkin, and with his money secured
by many pins in the lining of his cap.</p>

<p>"Be careful not to lose it, for your Uncle Nathan
would never forgive you," his mother had said, and
he cried cheerily, as he walked swiftly down the
lane to the highway:</p>

<p>"There's no fear of anything like that happening;
the bills can't get away without my knowing
it so long as they stay here," and Teddy pulled his
cap yet more closely down on his head.</p>

<p>In a trifle more than two hours he was at Waterville,
wondering why the stores were not open, no
matter how early it was, when such an important
customer as himself came to town.</p>

<p>Since the merchants were evidently ignorant of
his arrival, as was evidenced by the fact that their
places of business yet remained closed, there was
no more profitable occupation for him than to eat a
second breakfast, which he proceeded to do, using
a hand-truck on the depot-platform as a seat.</p>

<p>The train which left New York on the evening<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
before had arrived some time previous, and the
station was temporarily deserted by all save a boy
of about Teddy's age, who was walking to and fro
in an aimless manner.</p>

<p>By the time the young "fakir" had finished his
second biscuit he noticed that the stranger was
watching him narrowly, and, holding forth the
napkin with its generous store, he asked:</p>

<p>"Have one?"</p>

<p>"I don't care if I do," said the boy, carelessly,
and he continued:</p>

<p>"I reckon you live 'round here?"</p>

<p>"No, I jest come up from Peach Bottom Run, an'
am waiting for the stores to be opened."</p>

<p>"Why, you're from the same place where the fair
is goin' to be held."</p>

<p>"No; I live at the Run, an' the fair is over to
Peach Bottom, most five miles from my house. Are
you goin' there?"</p>

<p>"I should reckon I was. Why, I'm goin' to help
run it."</p>

<p>"You are?" and Teddy's mouth opened wide in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir-ree, an' you fellers will be jest about
crazy when I tell you what I've come to do."</p>

<p>"Don't flash it upon us too quick, for we wanter
kind of keep our wits about us till the fun is over."</p>

<p>The tone of sarcasm in Teddy's voice appeared to
nettle the stranger.<span class="pagenum">[16]</span></p>

<p>"I've come down here to give away a steamboat
what's worth five hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"Then there ain't any need for you to go any
farther, 'cause I'm willin' to take it now."</p>

<p>"If you won't be so smart I'll tell you about it,"
was the dignified reply. "There's a firm out in Detroit
what's goin' to do that very thing to the feller
that can guess how much she weighs, an' I've been
hired to help the man who is comin' down to Peach
Bottom to show off a lot of boats."</p>

<p>"What are you goin' to do?" and now Teddy was
interested.</p>

<p>"Row around in the creek while he looks out for
the stuff in the fair. It won't be any more'n fun,
an' if you'll come over I'll take you out."</p>

<p>"I don't s'pose you could help me guess how
much the steamer weighs, could you?"</p>

<p>"There ain't anybody as can do that, 'cause you
see she ain't built yet; but you can find out all
about it by lookin' on the fair grounds for the circulars
what the Davis Boat and Oar Company of
Detroit will throw around, an' if there's somethin'
else you wanter know jest ask for Sam Balderston;
all the folks will know me before I've been there
very long."</p>

<p>"I'm going to work at the fair myself," Teddy replied,
and then, in response to his new friend's
questions, he gave him all the particulars of his
proposed venture.<span class="pagenum">[17]</span></p>

<p>"I reckon you'll get along all right, an' come out
way ahead, if some of these smart fakirs don't try
to get the best of you. Say, why can't I go to your
house, an' stay till it's time to go over to the fair?
I'll pay my way."</p>

<p>"If mother's willin', I'd like to have you, an' I
don't believe she'll care. Now, I've got to buy my
stuff. Where'll I meet you afterward?"</p>

<p>"I'm goin' with you," Sam said, in a matter-of-fact
tone. "I know a good deal about such things,
an' won't see you cheated."</p>

<p>Teddy hardly thought he was in need of any assistance;
but since he did not want to offend this
fellow who was concerned in giving away a steamboat,
he could not well refuse, therefore the two
started up the street together.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>AN OLD FAKIR.</i></p>

<p>Sam had very much advice to give during the
short walk, and while the greater portion of it
was worthless, there were bits which might be of
value to the young "fakir."</p>

<p>"Don't buy anything till you have seen all there
is in town, an' then you'll know which is the cheapest,"
Sam repeated several times, with an air of
wisdom, and Teddy believed this to be a good
idea.</p>

<p>With this object in view the two boys walked
from store to store, examining that particular quality
of canes and knives which Teddy thought
would be best suited to his purpose, and Sam had
no hesitation in criticising the goods boldly, until
more than one of the clerks lost his temper entirely
and refused to show the full stock.</p>

<p>"If you go on this way, Sam, we won't get the
business done to day, an' I want to send the stuff
down in the stage, which leaves here at three
o'clock."</p>

<p>"There'll be plenty of time for that; I know what
I'm about. Now, if you had sent your money to me,<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
I'd got you a dandy lot in New York for almost
nothing."</p>

<p>"Seein's how I didn't even know your name till a
couple of hours ago, there wasn't much chance for
me to do that, an' I guess I'll make out well enough
here if you don't keep on raisin' a fuss with the
clerks."</p>

<p>"I won't so much as yip ag'in, if that's the way
you look at it. The question is, which store you're
goin' to buy from?"</p>

<p>"There's a place near the depot that wasn't open
when we came past. Let's go there, an' then I'll
make up my mind."</p>

<p>Sam, feeling a trifle injured because his advice
had not been fully appreciated, said nothing more
until they were near the station, and then, seeing a
train approaching, he proposed that they stop for a
few minutes.</p>

<p>"Jest as likely as not there'll be people on it
whom I know goin' to the fair, an' you want to get
acquainted with all the fakirs, so's they'll help you
along now an' then."</p>

<p>"The stage goes at three."</p>

<p>"An' it ain't more'n ten now. Come on!" Sam
cried, triumphantly, as he motioned for Teddy to
come nearer.</p>

<p>Sam had already quickened his pace, and Teddy
was forced to follow, or injure the feelings of one
whom he believed held a responsible position in the<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
Peach Bottom exhibition. Among the passengers
alighting from the train as the boys arrived was a
man who carried a large package enveloped in
green cloth, and Sam whispered, excitedly:</p>

<p>"I'll bet that's an old fakir, and if he is we want
to let him know who we are."</p>

<p>Teddy failed to understand exactly why this was
necessary; but his companion seemed so positive on
the point that he remained silent.</p>

<p>This particular passenger appeared to have plenty
of time at his disposal. He placed his package at
one end of the platform, lighted a pipe, and then
walked to and fro as the remainder of the travelers
dispersed.</p>

<p>"You foller me, an' we'll find out who he is,"
Sam whispered, when he thought a fitting opportunity
had come, and then advanced boldly toward
the stranger. "Goin' to the fair?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; what of it?"</p>

<p>"Nothin', only I s'pose you know you've got to
take another train here."</p>

<p>"If I didn't why would I be loafin' around this
dead place?"</p>

<p>"I jest spoke of it 'cause this feller an' I are goin'
there, too," and Sam waved his hand in the direction
where Teddy was standing.</p>

<p>"I s'pose there'll be other boys besides you at the
fair, eh?"</p>

<p>"But we belong to it. I'm to give a steamboat
<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>away, an' he's goin' to run a cane an' knife board.
We're waiting here to buy the stock."</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">THE THREE NOTES WERE HANDED TO THE GENEROUS STRANGER.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are, eh?" and now the man appeared to
be interested. "I reckon you're goin' to spend as
much as a dollar?"</p>

<p>"One? Why, he's got fifteen, an' the whole of it
will be spent before the stage leaves. We know
something about the business an' don't count on
gettin' an outfit for nothing."</p>

<p>"I thought you was a fakir," the man said, in a
more friendly tone, as, unobserved by the worldly-wise
Sam, he made a peculiar gesture to a stranger
immediately in the rear.</p>

<p>"That's what I am," was the proud reply, "an'
I'll make things hum over at Peach Bottom before
I leave the town. You see I thought I'd speak to
you, 'cause all of us fellers should know each
other."</p>

<p>"You're right, an' it's mighty lucky you did
strike up an acquaintance, for I can give you a big
lift. I've helped many a boy into the business when
they had money enough to help themselves."</p>

<p>The last dozen words were spoken in a loud tone,
as if for the benefit of the stranger in the rear; but
instead of waiting to hear more the latter turned
abruptly and walked toward the package with a
green covering at the end of the platform.</p>

<p>"I knew we oughter talk with you."</p>

<p>"Did you count on buying your stuff in this one-horse<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
town?" the man asked as Teddy approached,
and the latter replied:</p>

<p>"There wasn't any other place I could go to,
'cause it costs too much for a ticket to New York."</p>

<p>"How big a stock do you want?"</p>

<p>"All I can get for fifteen dollars. Don't you think
that will be enough?"</p>

<p>"It depends," the stranger replied, reflectively.
"If you buy the goods here you'll have to pay such
a big price that it won't be much of a pile. Now, if&mdash;I've
got the very thing in mind! You'll remember
the day you saw me if my plan works. I know
a fakir here who has a fine layout that he wants to
sell. You can get fifty dollars' worth of stuff for&mdash;well,
he asks twenty; but I'll say you are friends
of mine, an' the chances are you can make a trade."</p>

<p>"That would be a regular snap!" Sam cried, and
Teddy's eyes glistened at the thought of thus procuring
a full outfit so cheaply.</p>

<p>"I'll do what I can for you," the man said, in a
patronizing tone. "At any rate, I'll make him come
down in his price, and if there's any balance it can
be paid after the fair has been opened long enough
for you to take in some money."</p>

<p>"If business is good, I'm willing to do what is
right," Teddy replied; "but I must pay Uncle Nathan
first."</p>

<p>"How much do you owe him?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen dollars."<span class="pagenum">[23]</span></p>

<p>"Why, bless my soul, it'll be a pretty poor fair if
you can't make five times that amount in the first
two days."</p>

<p>"Where can we see the man?" Sam asked, eager
that his wonderfully good trade should be consummated
at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

<p>"I don't know; but he's somewhere in the town.
Give me your cash, an' I'll hunt him up inside of
half an hour. The stuff is right here in the baggage-room,
and you can ship it on the stage without
any trouble."</p>

<p>Just for an instant Teddy hesitated to part with
what seemed to him like an enormous amount of
money; but then came the thought that an old fakir
would not wrong a young one&mdash;and he considered
himself such. After some little difficulty he succeeded
in extracting all the pins, and the three
notes were handed to the generous stranger almost
at the same moment that the green-covered package
disappeared from the edge of the platform
simultaneously with the departure of the second
stranger.</p>

<p>"Wait right here for me," the man said, as he put
the money in his pocket. "I've got too much work
to do to spend any very great amount of time hunting
you fellows up in case you don't stay in one
place."</p>

<p>After thus cautioning them, the old fakir walked
slowly away, and Sam said:<span class="pagenum">[24]</span></p>

<p>"It was lucky you fell in with me, Teddy, for I
know how these things are worked, an' can give
you a good many pointers before the fair is over.
Why, you'll have a first-class outfit for about half
what it's worth."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a good chance; but I can't see why he
didn't take us with him if he was in a hurry, an'
then he wouldn't have had to come back."</p>

<p>"He's got to do that anyway, for his stuff is
here," Sam replied, pointing toward where he had
last seen the man's package; but it was no longer
there. "I guess the baggage-master has taken it
in," he added; "but you needn't be afraid of losin'
your money while I'm with you."</p>

<p>Then Sam occupied his companion's attention by
telling of his many alleged wonderful exploits,
and an hour passed before his story was concluded.</p>

<p>In the meantime one train had arrived and departed;
another was on the point of leaving the
depot, bound for Peach Bottom, when Teddy cried
as he leaped to his feet:</p>

<p>"See! I'm certain that's the man who has got
my money!"</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"On the platform of the front car!"</p>

<p>Before he could say anything more the train
steamed out, leaving the would-be young fakir
staring at it in distress and consternation.</p>

<p>"Of course it wasn't him," Sam said, confidently,
<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>when the last car had disappeared from view.
"The stuff he was goin'to buy for you is here in
the baggage-room, 'cause he said so, an' we'll see
him before long."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus025.jpg" width="600" height="444" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">&quot;See! I&#39;m certain that&#39;s the man who has got my money.&quot;</p>

<p>Teddy's suspicions had been aroused, and he was
not easily quieted. The thought that it was possible
he might have lost the money loaned him by
Uncle Nathan was sufficient to cause the liveliest
fear, and he said, decidedly:</p>

<p>"I'm going to know where that man's baggage
went to."</p>

<p>"How'll you find out?"</p>

<p>"Ask the baggage-master."</p>

<p>"Don't make a fool of yourself. It would be nice
for an old fakir like that man to know you thought
he'd steal your money."</p>

<p>"I don't care what he knows, so long as I get my
fifteen dollars back."</p>

<p>Teddy, trembling with apprehension and excitement,
went into the baggage-room and asked
there if a green-covered package had been taken in
by any of the attendants.</p>

<p>No one had seen such an article, and all were positive
there was nothing of the kind remaining in
their charge.</p>

<p>Then he asked if a bundle of canes had been left
there, and to this question there was a most decided
negative.</p>

<p>"The hangers-on at the fairs haven't begun to<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
come yet," the baggage-master said, "and when
they do come, we sha'n't have any of their stuff to
handle, for it will all be transferred across the platform
without being brought in here. What is the
matter? Anything gone wrong?"</p>

<p>The lump which had been rising in Teddy's
throat was now so large that it was with difficulty
he could say:</p>

<p>"A man has run off with fifteen dollars of mine,
an' Uncle Nathan will jest about kill me!"</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>A FRIEND.</i></p>

<p>The baggage-master immediately displayed the
utmost sympathy for the victim of the old fakir's
seductive scheme, and Sam was loud in his denunciations
of a brother in the craft who would serve
them in such a shabby manner.</p>

<p>"You leave him to me, an' I'll show you what
can be done," that young gentleman said, and
Teddy replied, reproachfully:</p>

<p>"I've left too much to you already. If you hadn't
thought it was necessary to make the acquaintance
of every fellow who was going to the fair I'd
have my fifteen dollars in my cap now."</p>

<p>"I'll get them back for you."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I can't say jest now; but you wait an' see what
I can do."</p>

<p>Inasmuch as Teddy must account first to his
mother and afterward to Uncle Nathan for that
amount, the confident assertion of his friend failed
to give him any mental relief, and he said, quite
sharply:<span class="pagenum">[28]</span></p>

<p>"You thought it was all right to give the money
to him, an' if you didn't know any more than a
country boy who'd never even heard of such fellows,
I can't see how you can do much toward
helping."</p>

<p>At this point the baggage-master, who had been
listening to the conversation, broke in with the
sage remark:</p>

<p>"It's no use for you fellows to fight over what
has been done. The money is gone; there's no
doubt about that; but it may be you can get it
back."</p>

<p>"How?" Teddy asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>"By notifying the police, and it is possible that
they may find your man long before the fair is
ended."</p>

<p>"But even if they should, how can I pay Uncle
Nathan the eighteen dollars he wants, after givin'
Deacon Jones the ten which I promised?"</p>

<p>"That, of course, is a question I cannot answer,"
the officer of the company replied, not unkindly;
"but it will certainly be better to get some of the
money back than to lose the whole."</p>

<p>"Of course it will," Sam said, promptly, after
waiting a few seconds without hearing any reply
from Teddy. "Tell us what to do, an' I'll see to the
whole thing."</p>

<p>"Hello! What kind of a meeting are you holding
here?" a cheery voice cried, and, looking up, the<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
disconsolate Teddy saw a merchant whose stock
he had been examining a short time previous.</p>

<p>In a few words the baggage-master explained the
condition of affairs.</p>

<p>"Can nothing be done?" the merchant asked.</p>

<p>"It is barely possible. The fact of the matter is
that the two swindlers left on the last train, and
this boy's money has gone with them beyond a
doubt."</p>

<p>Then the merchant turned to the would-be fakir
and asked for further particulars, which were
readily given, the latter saying, as he finished the
sad story:</p>

<p>"Uncle Nathan is bound to raise a big row, an' I
won't be able to help mother, as I counted on doing;
but I s'pose it serves me right."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that, lad, for all of us are liable
to be taken in at some time or another. It is
possible you may make money at the fair, and I
will give you credit to the amount you lost. Go to
the store, show this slip, and get what you think
may be needed."</p>

<p>While speaking the merchant had been writing
on a piece of paper torn from his memorandum
book, and when he handed it to Teddy the almost
heartbroken boy read the following words:</p>

<blockquote><p>The bearer, Edward Hargreaves, is entitled to
credit, thirty days' time, on all he may need, to the
extent of thirty dollars.</p>

<p class="smcap author">John Reaves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum">[30]</span></p>

<p>"But I only lost fifteen dollars," Teddy said, as
he read the order.</p>

<p>"I so understood; but you may need more, therefore
I have made the amount sufficiently large.
Don't hesitate to buy what is wanted, and whether
you ever find the swindler or not, I feel very positive
my bill will be paid."</p>

<p>Teddy tried to thank the merchant, but that lump
in his throat was still too near his mouth to admit
of many words, and Sam whispered:</p>

<p>"Don't say anything more about it. You've
struck the biggest kind of luck, and the safest way
is to hold your tongue."</p>

<p>Even had it been possible to speak, Teddy could
not have said all that was in his heart, and before
Sam had time to give any further advice the merchant
boarded a train which was just starting for
New York, leaving the young fakir and his newly-made
friend to settle matters among themselves.</p>

<p>"You're in big luck," the latter said, consolingly.
"What's the difference if you have lost fifteen dollars
so long as you know how to get thirty dollars'
worth of goods to start in business?"</p>

<p>"But this bill will have to be paid, and Uncle
Nathan must have his money; that leaves me
forty-five dollars in debt."</p>

<p>"S'pose'n it does? You're bound to make a good
deal more'n that, an' I'm here to help you through."</p>

<p>Teddy came very near saying that if Sam had not<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
been there the fifteen dollars would still be reposing
beneath the lining of his cap; but he succeeded
in checking himself, and the reproachful words
remained unspoken.</p>

<p>At this point in the conversation the baggage-master
insisted that information of the swindler
should be given to the police, and, whether they
desired to do so or not, the boys were forced to accompany
him to headquarters.</p>

<p>Here it is possible their story might have been
told without exciting more than ordinary interest
if the name of the kindly-disposed merchant had
not been used; but that was sufficient to awaken a
decided interest, and every detail was written down
carefully.</p>

<p>"We will try to get the money for you," the
chief said. "Several of my men will be at the fair,
and if you see this fellow again, information must
be given to them immediately."</p>

<p>Teddy had but little hope that any good would
result by this means, but he promised faithfully
to do as requested, and then the boys were at liberty
to finish the business which had been interrupted
so disastrously.</p>

<p>So much time had been wasted that it was necessary
to move around very lively in order to have
the goods ready before the stage should leave, and
Teddy did a great deal toward expediting matters
by explaining to the clerk at the store on which he<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
had the order for credit exactly what he proposed
to do.</p>

<p>The young man understood at once the kind of
goods which would be needed, and without listening
to the many suggestions made by Sam selected
a good assortment of both knives and canes.</p>

<p>"Ain't you getting more than thirty dollars'
worth?" Teddy asked, as the clerk continued to add
to the pile.</p>

<p>"I think not. These are all cheap goods, you
know, and make a big show without amounting to
any very great value. I will put in cotton cloth
enough for the cane board, and as many rings as
you will need unless business should be very brisk."</p>

<p>The clerk was bent on making the bill exactly the
size of the order, and when the prices had been
figured out Teddy had invested just thirty dollars in
a stock which must bring in a profit of at least
fifty per cent. in order to admit of his paying the
debts already contracted.</p>

<p>The goods were to be put on the stage by the
salesman, and there was nothing further for the
boys to do but decide on their manner of traveling
to the Run.</p>

<p>"After losin' fifteen dollars, I reckon there's only
one thing for me to do," Teddy said, as they left the
store. "I'm goin'to walk; but you can do as you
please."</p>

<p>"S'pose'n we both ride? You're bound to make a<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
pile of money before the fair is over, an' can
afford&mdash;&mdash; By jinks! There's that fakir now!"</p>

<p>In an instant Sam was off at full speed, crying:
"Stop thief!" with the full strength of his lungs, as
he pursued a man carrying a bundle covered with
green cloth.</p>

<p>Such an appeal was well calculated to arouse
every idler in the immediate vicinity, and before
Teddy fully understood what had happened not
less than twenty men and boys were in chase of
the stranger, who, strange to say, had not quickened
his pace.</p>

<p>The thought that it might yet be possible to regain
his money lent unusual speed to the would-be
fakir's heels, and he was among the foremost when
the man suddenly halted, turned squarely around,
and asked:</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you people? Do you
want me?"</p>

<p>"I guess we do," a policeman replied, as he seized
the stranger by the collar. "Somebody yelled
for us to stop the thief, and you must be the
man."</p>

<p>"Who says I am?" was the angry question.</p>

<p>By this time both Teddy and Sam had discovered
the latter's mistake. The only point of resemblance
between this stranger and the one who stole the
money was that both carried packages covered
with green cloth; but while the first bundle was<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
bulky and apparently heavy, this was small and
readily held under the man's arm.</p>

<p>Sam did not wait to explain matters. Fearing
lest he might get into serious trouble because of
the mistake, he slipped quietly away, leaving Teddy
to bear the brunt of the accused's wrath.</p>

<p>The latter realized that something must be done
at once, for the greater portion of the crowd was
looking inquiringly at him, and he said, in a voice
which was far from steady:</p>

<p>"I didn't do the hollerin'; but a feller who was
with me when a man stole my money thought you
must be the one."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" the stranger asked, advancing
threateningly.</p>

<p>"I don't know. He ran away when he saw it was
a mistake."</p>

<p>The crowd immediately began to disperse. The
policeman called down quite the reverse of blessings
on Sam's head, and then walked away,
leaving Teddy and the stranger comparatively
alone.</p>

<p>"I don't know as it does any harm to have a lot
of fools chasing a man," the latter said, "but it
might give him a bad name in his work."</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry, sir, but you see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not blaming you, my boy, since it was the
other fellow who did the mischief. Tell me how
you lost your stuff."<span class="pagenum">[35]</span></p>

<p>"My what?"</p>

<p>"Your stuff&mdash;money."</p>

<p>"Oh!" and Teddy at once gave the stranger a
detailed account of all that had happened, the latter
saying, as the story was concluded:</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be afraid to bet my head that Long
Jim was the duck who played the trick. I know he
came here, headed for the fair grounds, and it's
jest about his style of working."</p>

<p>"Do you think there's any chance I'll get it
back?"</p>

<p>"He shall give up if I see him. I'll be at the fair
myself, working a neat little game, and will see
you there."</p>

<p>With this remark the stranger walked away, and
Teddy went toward the depot once more, feeling
quite certain he had made a friend who would aid
him in his new venture.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>UNCLE NATHAN.</i></p>

<p>When Teddy reached the depot he was not
obliged to hunt very long for Sam, for that
young gentleman crept out from behind a pile of
baggage on seeing his friend was alone, and asked,
in a hoarse whisper:</p>

<p>"What did that feller do to you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; but that don't prove we should get out
of another scrape so easily, and you must be careful,
or we'll be in no end of trouble before the fair
is ended."</p>

<p>"I was only tryin' to catch your money."</p>

<p>"It surely wouldn't have done any harm if you
had found out whether that was the man or not
before you started the whole crowd after him."</p>

<p>"That's right, rub it into a feller when he tries to
do you a good turn," Sam said, sarcastically, and
then remembering an instant later that he proposed
to be this boy's guest, he added, "I was only lookin'
out for you, an' so long as there's been no harm
done we needn't talk about it. Do you still mean
to walk home?"<span class="pagenum">[37]</span></p>

<p>"There's nothing else to be done, if we want to
get to the Run to-night, for the stage left while we
were chasing that man."</p>

<p>This was exactly what he did not want to do;
but, under the circumstances, there was no help
for it, and the young gentleman who expected to
form such a prominent portion of the fair set out
by the side of the friend whom he had injured
while thinking to do him a favor.</p>

<p>At the end of a trifle less than three hours, when
both were footsore, hungry, and weary, the boys
arrived at Teddy's home, and Mrs. Hargreaves
made the stranger welcome despite the inconvenience
caused by his coming.</p>

<p>Not until after Sam had retired did Teddy tell
his mother of the theft, and for several moments
the widow was in great mental distress; but finally
she viewed the matter in a more cheerful light, and
it was resolved that Uncle Nathan should not be
told of the mishap.</p>

<p>"It would only make him angry," Mrs. Hargreaves
said, "and you must pay him before the
merchant who was so kind to you gets his money;
but I am terribly afraid, Teddy, that the whole
scheme will be a failure."</p>

<p>The amateur fakir assured her as best he could,
and when they retired that night both Teddy and
his mother were in a comparatively contented
frame of mind.<span class="pagenum">[38]</span></p>

<p>The following day was Sunday, on which not
even the all engrossing topic of cane-boards and
knives was to be discussed; but before the family
had finished breakfast the arrival of a stranger
forced them into worldly topics.</p>

<p>The newcomer was none other than the man
whom Sam had accused of being the thief, and he
explained the cause of his visit by saying:</p>

<p>"I have reason to believe that Long Jim, the
fakir who got away with your son's money, will be
over here to-night, because the hotels at Peach
Bottom are crowded, and it is possible he may be
forced to give up the stuff." Although not exactly
understanding what he meant, the widow insisted
on his coming into the house, and he laid the details
of his plan before Teddy and Sam.</p>

<p>"I'll hang around here for him," the stranger
said, "and you shall say if he is the man who did
you up; after that I'll take a hand in the business,
and it'll be queer if between us all we can't make
him do the square thing, more especially since the
rest of his gang haven't come yet."</p>

<p>As might be expected, Teddy was excited by the
prospect of recovering the money which he had
believed was lost beyond reclaim, and plans were
at once laid to trap the dishonest fakir.</p>

<p>While this conversation was being carried on
Uncle Nathan came in to learn how his nephew had
succeeded in town, and the stranger introduced<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
himself as Frank Hazelton, a dealer in jewelry,
which was to be on exhibition during the coming
week at the fair.</p>

<p>The old man was delighted to make the stranger's
acquaintance, for he fancied there would be an opportunity
for him to take the agency of a valuable
line of goods without the outlay of any money, and
in a very few moments the two were fast friends.</p>

<p>Uncle Nathan not only monopolized nearly all the
conversation, but insisted on showing Mr. Hazelton
around the village, and actually forced the latter
to accompany him, despite the fact that it was
Sunday, when an honest merchant is not supposed
to so much as think of business.</p>

<p>On the following day it would be necessary for
those who had purchased the privilege of doing
business on the fair grounds to be present, ready
to select their different sites for working, and very
shortly after the sun sank behind the hills Sam
and Teddy retired in order to be ready for an early
start next morning, since the first stage left the
Run at half-past five.</p>

<p>It lacked fully an hour of that time when the
boys were called to breakfast by Mrs. Hargreaves,
and in less than fifteen minutes they were at the
table eating a hearty breakfast, which was interrupted
by the appearance of Uncle Nathan, who
looked as if he had not been in bed since the evening
previous.<span class="pagenum">[40]</span></p>

<p>"I've been robbed!" he cried, passionately, "and
this is what comes of trying to help my nephew
enter a disreputable line of business. I believe you
induced that man to come here, explaining all about
my store, simply that he might act the burglar.
And it wouldn't take much to make me think you
had agreed to divide with him the ill-gotten gains,"
he added, shaking his fist in the direction of Teddy,
who was so astounded by the news as to be literally
incapable of movement.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Nathan?" Mrs. Hargreaves
cried.</p>

<p>"Just what I said! My store was robbed last
night, and your precious son knows the thief better
than I do!"</p>

<p>"You mean the man who came here yesterday?"
the widow asked, while Teddy and Sam gazed at
the old man in open-mouthed astonishment.</p>

<p>"Of course I do; who else could it be? Didn't I
take him over there yesterday, and didn't I explain
just how difficult it was to deposit money in a bank,
because a man would have to pay a dollar to go to
Waterville an' back, or trust the stage driver to do
the business?"</p>

<p>By this time Teddy had recovered something like
composure, and he said, gravely:</p>

<p>"We have no means of knowing what you said to
Mr. Hazelton, but if you told him all your business,
that is no concern of ours. You insisted on his going<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
away with you, and we haven't seen him since."</p>

<p>"But you lied to me about my money."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"You never said a word about its being stolen."</p>

<p>"If I never said a word I couldn't have told a lie.
He has evidently given the whole story; but what
happened in Waterville has nothing to do with the
robbery of your store."</p>

<p>"Oh, it hasn't, eh? Well, I'm beginning to think
it was a job cooked up by all hands to get the best
of me."</p>

<p>"If it had been," and now Teddy was on his feet,
looking the angry old man squarely in the face,
"why wouldn't I have said something about it in
order to make the story seem straighter? A merchant
in Waterville trusted me for the goods I
wanted after he heard the money was gone, and I
count on paying you before I do him."</p>

<p>"Oh, you do, eh? Well, it's mighty doubtful
whether you or this precious friend of yours will
ever see the fair, for I'm going to get out a warrant
for the whole lot before I'm done with this thing."</p>

<p>"Would you arrest Teddy when he has been in
this house ever since you left here yesterday morning?"
Mrs. Hargreaves cried.</p>

<p>"I'll have my money back, and the sooner your
smart son tells me where it is, the sooner he can
go about his business; but he must first pay me
back my eighteen dollars."<span class="pagenum">[42]</span></p>

<p>"I only borrowed fifteen, Uncle Nathan, and that
you will get before next Wednesday. If you want
to arrest me, go ahead; but I promise that you'll
be sorry for it."</p>

<p>"So you threaten, do you? That's what comes of
trying to help an ungrateful boy! I knew he was
going to the bad from the first minute he talked
about having a cane-board," the old man added, as
he turned to the widow, "and I predict that he'll
come to no good even if he manages to get out of
this scrape."</p>

<p>"You thought it was a good idea for me to do as
I proposed," Teddy replied, standing his ground
bravely, "and was willing to loan me the money,
provided I would pay you three dollars for the use
of fifteen for one week."</p>

<p>"That's right; throw in my teeth what I wanted
to do in order to help you along, and call me an old
skinflint. I am old enough to expect such things
from such as you."</p>

<p>"I haven't called you any names, nor do I intend
to do so; I only wanted mother to know the truth
of the business between us. Do you really believe
I had any hand in breaking into your store?"</p>

<p>"If you didn't your friends did, and that amounts
to the same thing, as you'll soon find out. I'll have
a warrant issued for the arrest of the whole crowd,
if you don't tell me the truth this very minute."</p>

<p>"But I don't know anything, Uncle Nathan."<span class="pagenum">[43]</span></p>

<p>"I'll have the truth out of you before the day is
ended," the old man cried, angrily, and without
saying or doing anything save to shake his fist in
the direction of his nephew and Sam he left the house.</p>

<p>As yet none of the little party knew the full extent
of what had happened, but before Uncle
Nathan was fairly out of the yard a neighbor came
around to tell Mrs. Hargreaves that the old man's
store had been entered by burglars on the night
previous, and a large amount of money, together
with the most valuable goods, had been carried away.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to imagine the consternation
which seized upon the little party after Uncle
Nathan's departure. Teddy was so overwhelmed
that it was literally impossible for him to say a
word, and Sam shook like one in an ague fit at the
thought that he might be carried off to jail before
it was possible for him to astonish the people by
his skill as an oarsman.</p>

<p>"You must not think of leaving here until we
know what your uncle proposes to do," Mrs. Hargreaves
said, as she returned to the dining-room
after talking with the neighbor. "Of course I know
that neither of you two boys had anything to do
with the robbery; but you must not run away."</p>

<p>"I've got to leave, no matter what the old fool
says," Sam replied. "I don't know how the folks
would get along if I didn't show up, an' it won't do
to disappoint them."<span class="pagenum">[44]</span></p>

<p>"Are you going?" Teddy asked, and Sam replied
in a voice which trembled despite all his efforts to
make it sound firm:</p>

<p>"Of course I am. You don't allow I'm such an
idiot as to stay till he can have me arrested, an' if
you're sensible, both of us will go."</p>

<p>"I must stay here, an' lose all my chances of
making money," Teddy said, gloomily.</p>

<p>"All right, then I'm off, an' after I once get on
the fair grounds I'll bet that old duffer won't get
hold of me."</p>

<p>Sam did not propose to lose any time. He had no
baggage, and in a very few moments after so deciding
he was walking up the road over which the
stage would pass, while Teddy, with a heavier heart
than he had ever known before, waited for his
uncle to send the officers of the law to carry him to
prison.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>THE FAIR.</i></p>

<p>It seemed to Teddy as if everything pleasant in
life had departed from him as he waited for the
return of Uncle Nathan accompanied by the officers
of the law, and neither he nor his mother had any
idea that the visit would be long delayed.</p>

<p>The widow had every proof, even if her heart had
not told the truth, that her son was innocent of the
charge which the angry old man made. She knew
both he and Sam remained in the house during the
entire day previous to the robbery, and it would
have been almost impossible for them to have left
during the night without her knowledge; but at the
same time it was only reasonable she should be distressed
in mind as to the final outcome of the matter.</p>

<p>One, two, three hours passed, and yet no arrest
had been made.</p>

<p>Teddy no longer hoped to play the part of fakir
at the fair; but yet he fancied it might be possible
to sell his stock, which had already been forwarded
by the stage, to some more fortunate fellow, and<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
in order to do this it was necessary he should be on
the grounds at the earliest possible hour; but the
charge made by his uncle held him a voluntary
prisoner.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock a neighbor, whose love of gossip
was greater than her desire for housework, came
to the garden gate to say that she had just heard
the justice of the peace refuse to issue a warrant
for either of the boys, and she added to this information
her belief that it, the burglary, was a judgment
upon Uncle Nathan for presuming to talk
business on the Sabbath.</p>

<p>When this busybody had departed, Mrs. Hargreaves
said, as she re-entered the house:</p>

<p>"There is no longer any reason, Teddy, why you
shouldn't carry out your plans. Every one in this
village knows where to find you in case a warrant
is granted, which doesn't now seem possible, and
it is better to go ahead as you proposed, knowing
that your mother is certain you are innocent of any
wrongdoing."</p>

<p>Teddy's one desire had been to be on the fair
grounds, and when this advice was given from "a
fellow's best friend," he started at once, saying as
he left the house:</p>

<p>"I'll come back if there's nothing to do; but
there's no reason to worry if you don't see me until
Saturday, for I shall stay jest as long as things run
smooth."<span class="pagenum">[47]</span></p>

<p>Ten minutes later, while he was trudging along
the dusty road with no other idea than that he
would be forced to walk the entire distance, a
friend in a wagon overtook him, proposed that he
ride, and before the fair grounds were reached
he had heard all the particulars of the robbery.</p>

<p>It appeared that the burglars must have effected
an entrance to Uncle Nathan's store after midnight
Saturday, and when the proprietor arrived on the
following morning there was absolutely no clue to
the thieves.</p>

<p>"They must have had a wagon to take away all
the old man says he has lost," Teddy's informant
added, as the story was concluded, "and because of
that the justice refused to issue a warrant for the
man who slept at the hotel last night. Of course
the idea that you knew anything about it was all in
that old fool's eye."</p>

<p>"Then nobody has been arrested?" Teddy exclaimed,
in surprise.</p>

<p>"Of course not, an' more than one in town hopes
he'll never see hide nor hair of his goods or money;
but between you an' me I don't believe he's lost
half as much as he tries to make out."</p>

<p>To this last assertion Teddy gave but little heed;
the all absorbing thought in his mind was as to
whether he would actually be arrested for the
crime, and this was sufficient to prevent any speculations<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
as to the amount of loss, or his former
dreams of the future.</p>

<p>Arriving at the fair grounds, he found everything
in a state of confusion. Goods were arriving
and being put in place; men were quarreling for
this or that vantage ground, and carpenters were
busy in every direction.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, he knew that all this would
be changed on the following day when the visitors
began to arrive; but, nevertheless, it gave him a
homesick feeling which he could not suppress, and,
for a time, prevented him from attending to his
own interests.</p>

<p>"Hello! What are you sittin' there for?" a
voice cried, after he had remained inactive near
the entrance nearly an hour, debating in his own
mind whether or not it would be worth the while
to unpack the goods which he knew were awaiting
his call somewhere on the grounds.</p>

<p>Looking up quickly he saw Sam, self-possessed
and jaunty as at the first moment he met him in
Waterville, but wearing an air of considerably
more importance.</p>

<p>"Have you gone to work yet?" he asked, listlessly.</p>

<p>"Of course not; there's nothin' for me to do till
the folks begin to come in to see how well I can
row a boat. What did the old duffer do?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean Uncle Nathan?"<span class="pagenum">[49]</span></p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"He hasn't had anybody arrested yet; but there's
no knowin' how soon he'll begin."</p>

<p>"He'd better not try it on me," Sam said, with
an assumption of boldness. "I've found a feller
here that's goin' to show off rifles, an' I can borrow
as many as I want if he does any funny business."</p>

<p>"Would you shoot anybody?"</p>

<p>"You jest stay till an old lunatic comes along
sayin' I've helped to rob him when your mother
knows where I was, an' see what I'll do," Sam
replied, in a really bloodthirsty tone as he turned
to walk away, and then, as if reconsidering the
matter, he stopped long enough to say, "Wait here
a minute, an' I'll show you a feller what knows a
thing or two."</p>

<p>Inasmuch as Teddy had no idea of moving from
the position he had taken up near the gate it was
not irksome to do as the exhibitor of boats requested,
and without troubling his head as to who
this very important person might be, he remained
at the precise spot until Sam returned with a boy
who appeared to be a year or two older than himself.</p>

<p>"This is Dan Summers, an' he's here to help show
off a dandy rifle made in Chicopee Falls down in
Massachusetts, or some such place. He'll help us
out of the scrape if anybody can."</p>

<p>Dan looked as if this introduction was disagreeable<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
to him rather than otherwise, and after nodding
to Teddy, he said, in an explanatory tone:</p>

<p>"I'm here to help the man what exhibits goods
from the Stevens Arms Company, that's all; but I
don't see how I could be of any help if you fellers
have got in a fuss."</p>

<p>"Neither do I," Teddy replied, and then to show
that no one could aid him, he told the whole story,
including all that Uncle Nathan had said.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't let that worry me," Dan said, philosophically,
when the tale was ended. "If you want
to make any money out of this fair it is time you
was lookin' out for a stand, an' I know of the best
place on the grounds. Come with me now, an'
you can get it before the crowd of fakirs have a
chance to take it up."</p>

<p>Teddy, rather liking the appearance of this boy,
resolved to follow his advice, and signified the
same by slipping down from the stack of exhibits,
as he said:</p>

<p>"Show it to me an' I'll get right to work, for
there's forty-five dollars I've got to pay back, no
matter what Uncle Nathan makes up his mind to
do."</p>

<p>"That's the way to talk," Sam cried, approvingly,
and forthwith he proceeded to take charge of his
two acquaintances, resolved that lack of energy
should not prevent him from sharing in their triumphs,
if indeed, they had any.<span class="pagenum">[51]</span></p>

<p>Dan professed to have had considerable experience
with fairs, and the manner in which he proceeded
to work showed that there had been no
boasting on his part. He selected a spot where
nearly all of the visitors would be forced to pass in
order to see the cattle or the racing, and set about
putting up a stand for Teddy in the most approved
manner.</p>

<p>He ordered Sam here and there to such places as
he had seen an accumulation of lumber, and so well
did he work, after borrowing an ax and a hatchet
from a "candy butcher," that it was not yet noon
when Teddy had an inclosure sufficiently large for
his purpose; the cloth was in place and the holes
cut for the canes, so that it would be but the work
of a few moments to make everything ready when
business should begin.</p>

<p>"You can't do the whole thing yourself if there
is anything like the crowd that ought to come,"
Dan said, "and I advise you to hire a clerk."</p>

<p>"Where'll I find one?" Teddy asked, helplessly.</p>

<p>"Take some of the fellers from your own village;
but be sure they're honest, for after business begins
there won't be any chance to watch 'em."</p>

<p>Teddy thought he could find the proper party
before the following day, and then came the question
of where they were to sleep.</p>

<p>"I've got that all fixed," Sam said, confidently.</p>

<p>"The man what runs the museum in that big<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
tent is a friend of mine, an' he won't say a word
if we stay under the canvas to-night."</p>

<p>"How long have you known him?" Teddy asked,
warned by previous experience that Sam's statements
were not always to be depended upon.</p>

<p>"I never saw him till this morning; but that
don't make no difference so long as he's willin' for
us to stay there."</p>

<p>"We'll go over an' look around," Dan said, leading
the way, and to the surprise of at least one of
the party it was found that Master Sam's statement
was absolutely correct.</p>

<p>The proprietor of the museum was more than
willing to allow the boys to sleep under his canvas,
for the very good reason that they would act as
sentinels in lieu of those he had neglected to hire,
and all three went away in search of a place where
they could obtain meals during the expected five
days of excitement and money-making.</p>

<p>This was even a more simple matter than the
first. At a boarding-house nearly opposite the
main entrance to the grounds they could be accommodated
at a reasonable rate, and the preliminaries
had been settled. It only remained now to welcome
the visitors, and get from them as much money as
possible.</p>

<p>Teddy almost forgot the terrible fact that his
Uncle Nathan might yet have him arrested, and
Sam acted as if such a thing had never been possible.<span class="pagenum">[53]</span></p>

<p>It is true all three of the boys discussed the possibility
of finding the money which had been stolen
from Teddy; but neither thought of connecting the
two crimes as the work of one person.</p>

<p>During the afternoon Teddy looked around in
the hope of seeing the man, unjustly accused of the
theft, who had promised to aid him; but as yet he
had not put in an appearance, and it seemed as if
all the choice places would be taken before he
arrived.</p>

<p>It was anything rather than sport to wander
around the almost deserted grounds, and at an
early hour, after partaking of a remarkably poor
supper, the three boys sought the seclusion granted
by the mildewed canvas of the alleged museum of
the "world's wonders."</p>

<p>A goat, a wax baby, two or three snakes, an alligator,
and a contortionist, who was none other than
the proprietor of this magnificent array of "marvels,"
made up the entire list of curiosities; but the
tent would shelter the young fakirs from the wind
and dew, and it was possible they might sleep as
soundly as at home.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>A CLUE.</i></p>

<p>Sam and Dan, who had worked at many fairs and
been forced to sleep in far less desirable places,
thought it was a rare piece of good fortune to get
such comfortable quarters free; but the prospect
of lying on the ground all night was far from pleasing
to Teddy.</p>

<p>He looked around for some spot softer than
another; but there was no choice, and he said to
himself:</p>

<p>"There's one satisfaction about it, I'm better off
on the ground than I would have been if Uncle
Nathan had succeeded in having me arrested and
put in jail."</p>

<p>This thought caused the interior of the tent to
seem less disagreeable, and he almost persuaded
himself that it would be sport to stay all night in a
museum with a real contortionist as host.</p>

<p>Dan had thrown himself at full length on the
ground where he could watch the proprietor of this<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
"enormous exhibition" cook his supper on an oil-stove,
and Sam, anxious about other people's affairs
as usual, devoted his entire time to asking questions
regarding the business.</p>

<p>"How do you count on gettin' along when the
crowds get here? You can't sell tickets an' act too."</p>

<p>"I've got a barker an' a clown coming to-morrow;
it was no use to pay 'em wages for layin'
around when there was nothing to be done but put
up the tent."</p>

<p>"What's a 'barker?'" Sam asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, the man who stands outside an' does the
talking, of course."</p>

<p>Then, his supper having been cooked and eaten,
the host amused himself and his guests by telling
of his experience in the show business; relating
stories and talking of the different fakirs he had
met.</p>

<p>"When I started out," he said, "I made up my
mind that a fortune could be made in one season. I
bought a fine tent; had lots of performers, about
twenty animals, and a dozen cases of stuffed birds
and other curiosities. We struck hard luck from
the sendoff, an' first the woman with an iron jaw
gave me the shake because she got tired of waiting
for the salary that never came. Two of the bears
grew so disgusted with the bad business that they
died, and one after another of the people skipped,
till I was pretty nigh alone. A sheriff in Harmer<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
seized the cases, another levied on my live stock,
and it has only taken two seasons to bring the show
down to where you see it."</p>

<p>This was not pleasing information for Teddy,
who was obliged to make such a large amount of
money in order to free himself from debt, and he
asked:</p>

<p>"Isn't it possible to make money at every fair? I
thought the fakirs got rich in a little while."</p>

<p>"So did I before I went into the business. A fellow
may make a big stake this week and lose it all
at the next stand. If you strike bad weather, or a
crowd that hasn't got any money, it's up-hill work
to pull in the entrance fee. Now, I have to pay a
hundred dollars for this privilege, because I've
got a big tent, and it wouldn't be any more if I had
a show to compare with it in size. It'll take a good
many ten-cent pieces to make that up."</p>

<p>This plain statement of facts caused Teddy to
figure how many nickels he must receive before
the capital invested and stolen would be returned,
and the result was far from gratifying.</p>

<p>"The eighteen dollars which must be given to
Uncle Nathan, the thirty I owe in Waterville, and
ten I paid for the privilege of running the boards
makes eleven hundred and sixty five-cent pieces.
I'll never see so many customers as that, and Aunt
Sarah was right when she called me a fool for
thinking of going into the business," he said to himself,<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
as his companions began to make their preparations
for the night.</p>

<p>It is useless to "cry over spilled milk," however,
and this he realized in time to prevent himself from
being plunged into the lowest depths of despondency.
It was barely possible business would be exceptionally
good, he argued mentally, and if hard
work could accomplish the desired result he must
be successful.</p>

<p>Dan was already lying down with his head
toward the side of the tent and his feet near the
oil-stove, which had been left burning because of
the dampness, and Teddy crawled over by the side
of him. Sam had decided to sleep by the side of his
host, probably with the idea that he might appear
to be on terms of greater intimacy, and all hands
gave themselves up to slumber.</p>

<p>The excitement of the morning and subsequent
labor had so tried Teddy that, despite the hardness
of his bed, he fell asleep in a very few moments,
and it was not yet nine o'clock when all the inmates
of the tent, save the goat, and possibly the
alligator and snakes, were wrapped in blissful unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Half an hour later a terrific yell from Sam caused
the remainder of the party to spring to their feet in
alarm.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" Dan cried.</p>

<p>"Somebody has got into the tent and been<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
poundin' me with a club! I'm pretty near
killed."</p>

<p>The faint glow cast by the oil-stove was not sufficient
to illumine any portion of the tent, and the
host made all haste to light a lantern, after which
Dan proceeded to search for the supposed intruder;
but before he had taken a dozen steps the proprietor
of the museum burst into a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>"Funny, ain't it?" Sam cried, angrily. "I s'pose
you'd laugh if I'd been killed in your old tent!"</p>

<p>This savage remark appeared to excite the man's
mirth rather than check it, and while he was thus
enjoying himself Teddy and Dan stood gazing at
him in surprise.</p>

<p>It was several minutes before the man could
speak, and then he said, as he pointed to the goat
who stood a short distance away calmly munching
some potato parings:</p>

<p>"That's the fellow who has been beating your
friend with a club. I always let him loose at night,
and he has walked over our dying boy."</p>

<p>Sam insisted that he had been beaten with a club;
but on examining his clothing two spots of fresh
earth were found, showing where the animal had
stepped. A hoof-print on the sleeve and another
directly on the breast of his coat comprised the full
amount of damage done.</p>

<p>The boy who had believed himself so dangerously
wounded now grew angry, and, leaping to his feet,<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
declared he would not remain in the tent another
minute unless the goat was tied.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to prevent your bunking somewhere
else," the owner of the animal replied, quite
sharply.</p>

<p>"Billy always has had the liberty of the tent at
night, and I reckon he won't lose it now."</p>

<p>Sam started toward the entrance; but before
reaching it he realized that he would be punishing
no one but himself, and slowly turned back, saying
as he approached the stove:</p>

<p>"It's too late to hunt for lodgings now, an' I
s'pose I'll have to make the best of it."</p>

<p>"I guess you will," the host replied, quietly, and
the angry Sam lay down on the seat of the baggage
wagon, to insure himself against another visit
from "Billy."</p>

<p>This incident had driven the desire for sleep from
the eyelids of Teddy and Dan, and they remained
awake some time after the loud breathing of their
companions told that the visit from the goat had
been temporarily effaced from their minds.</p>

<p>Now Teddy discovered what a hard, uncomfortable
bed the bare earth was, and after tossing
about for half an hour, he whispered to Dan:</p>

<p>"Do you suppose it would be any better in the
wagon?"</p>

<p>"No; you'll get used to it in a little while, and
the ground is softer than a board."<span class="pagenum">[60]</span></p>

<p>Teddy was about to reply when the sound of
voices from the outside attracted his attention, and
then came the crackle as of a match being lighted.</p>

<p>Two or more men had halted near the canvas
within a few feet of where the boys were lying,
evidently that they might be sheltered from the
wind while getting their pipes or cigars in working
order.</p>

<p>A moment later both the listeners heard one of
the newcomers say:</p>

<p>"I don't think it will be safe for you to show up
very much while we stay here."</p>

<p>"Why not? If them boys recognize me it will be
an easy matter to frighten 'em into holdin' their
tongues, and there's goin' to be good pickin's this
week."</p>

<p>"But what's the use of runnin' any risk? We've
made a fairly good haul already, an' it's better to
get safe off with that than stick our noses where
it'll be hard work to pull them back."</p>

<p>Teddy was in the highest possible excitement. In
the tone of the second speaker's voice he recognized
the man who had stolen his money, and he punched
Dan with his elbow to assure himself that the latter
was listening.</p>

<p>"Keep quiet," Dan whispered, and then the conversation
on the outside was continued.</p>

<p>"I'll take good care to keep shady, an' you see
what can be done to-morrow."</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">The boys crept through the flap of the tent and followed the two men.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>

<p>"Will you promise not to leave the house till after
dark?"</p>

<p>"I thought you had more nerve; but so long as
you haven't I reckon I'll promise, for this is bound
to be a fat thing, and I don't want to lose the
whole of it.</p>

<p>"When these country jays begin to send their
stuff home I'll have ours shipped, an' there's little
danger it'll be overhauled, more especially since
the old man couldn't get a warrant for the only one
he suspects. It's a safe bet that Hazelton has a
pretty good idea who did the job, an' if they make
trouble for him he'll most likely tell what he
thinks."</p>

<p>"There's no call to be afraid of him after he has
worked a couple of days, for those he ropes in
would do all they could to have him arrested."</p>

<p>The last portion of this remark was almost indistinguishable,
owing to the fact that the men were
walking away, and when the sound of their footsteps
could no longer be heard Teddy said:</p>

<p>"Those are the men who robbed Uncle Nathan's
store, an' I'm certain one of them got my money."</p>

<p>"Would you know their voices if you heard them
again?"</p>

<p>"Sure; but why don't we find out where they are
going? It wouldn't be a hard job."</p>

<p>"Are you willin' to sneak after them?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am. Come on!"<span class="pagenum">[62]</span></p>

<p>The boys arose softly and crept through the flap
of the tent without awakening the sleepers.</p>

<p>The night was dark and cloudy, and it was impossible
to see any very great distance in either
direction; but Dan had taken especial heed to the
course taken by the men, and he started off without
hesitation.</p>

<p>"We ought to have a club or something to protect
ourselves in case they should see us," Teddy
whispered.</p>

<p>"We won't get near enough to let them do much
mischief. Do you see two sparks over there? They
are the lighted ends of cigars, an' our men are
behind them."</p>

<p>Dan quickened his pace; but he had failed to
calculate the distance correctly, and was much
nearer the game than he had suspected.</p>

<p>"Be careful they don't see us," he said, in a low
tone, and in another instant the boys were directly
in front of the men.</p>

<p>Teddy started back in alarm; but he was too late.
In an instant the sparks flashed before his eyes,
and he fell to the ground unconscious just as Dan
succeeded in warding off the blow of a fist which
was aimed at him.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>THE CLERK.</i></p>

<p>When Teddy recovered from the vicious blow
which had rendered him unconscious he saw
Dan lying on the ground beside him, but no one else
was near.</p>

<p>It was as if they had been fighting with phantoms
of the brain, save for the fact that both bore the
most indisputable signs of having been assaulted
by beings of true flesh and blood.</p>

<p>One of Dan's eyes was closed as if by a violent
blow, and Teddy bled freely from the ear, the crimson
fluid telling eloquently of the exact location of
that superior force which had caused so many stars
to dance before his mental vision.</p>

<p>"We got through with that part of it mighty
quick," Dan said, ruefully, as he rose to his feet.
"There wasn't anything slow about the way they
struck out after we made fools of ourselves by running
into them, eh?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand how it all happened. It
wasn't more than three seconds from the time I<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
first saw them before there was a regular set of
fireworks dancing in front of my eyes."</p>

<p>"It so happens that they saw us first," Dan replied,
as he rubbed his head. "Those men were the
thieves, and what I said showed them that we were
on the scent."</p>

<p>"Where are they now?"</p>

<p>"You'll have to ask that question of someone
else," Dan said, with a grimace of pain. "The last
thing I know was when the tall fellow landed one
square on my nose, and before I recovered both
were out of sight. We have done harm rather than
good, for now they know we overheard the conversation,
an' we'll be mighty lucky if this is all we
get before the fair comes to an end."</p>

<p>"Suppose we tell the police now?"</p>

<p>"What can you say to them? We heard those
men talking about something which may have had
nothing to do with the robbery, and want to have
them arrested. On what grounds will we ask for a
warrant? Besides, if Nathan Hargreaves was my
uncle, I would let him fight his own battles."</p>

<p>"But I owe him eighteen dollars."</p>

<p>"What of that? He wouldn't take a penny off
if you got your head broke while trying to find his
money, and after all that has happened I think we
have good reason to let him severely alone."</p>

<p>"I'm willing to go back to the tent," Teddy said,
as he began to feel faint, and Dan aided him during<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
the short walk, both staggering as they came
through the flap, meeting their host near the entrance,
who asked, sharply:</p>

<p>"What has been going on? I counted on helping
a party of boys, rather than giving my tent up to a
lot of roughs, as you appear to be."</p>

<p>In the fewest possible words Dan explained what
had happened, and in addition told all the story of
Teddy's losing his money, together with the accusation
made by Uncle Nathan.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I said a word," and the proprietor of
the museum did really appear to be grieved. "It
makes no difference whether you got a whipping
or not, the guilty parties are here, and you can
count on my help in turning them up."</p>

<p>"That's what I'm afraid we sha'n't be able to
do," Teddy replied; "we tried our best to-night,
and got the worst of it."</p>

<p>"There is plenty of time between now and Saturday.
I'll do all any man can, an' it'll be strange if
we don't get some proof before the fair closes."</p>

<p>"How did you know we were out?" Dan asked.</p>

<p>"I saw you go, and there was no reason why I
should kick; but I began to be afraid you were up
to something crooked. Now I know the whole
story, I'll do my best to help you out of the scrape.
Go to sleep, and we'll talk the whole matter over
in the morning."</p>

<p>This was good advice, but not easily followed.<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
Both the boys began to feel the effects of the blows
received from the thieves, and the pain resulting
therefrom was not conducive to repose.</p>

<p>They did manage to close their eyes in slumber
now and then, however, and when the day broke
Mr. Sweet, the proprietor of the museum, was
standing ready to minister to their necessities.</p>

<p>"You haven't got exactly the right kind of faces
to bring very big business," he said, cheerily; "but
I reckon we can make a change in the general appearance.
Use this plentifully as a bath, and before
business opens you'll be respectable members
of society."</p>

<p>It was certainly necessary for them to do something
toward improving their appearance. Teddy's
ear was swollen to nearly twice its natural size,
and Dan had an eye which was rapidly blackening.</p>

<p>Thanks to the application provided by the owner
of the museum, these evidences of a fight were rapidly
reduced, and when Sam awoke they looked
little the worse for wear, although he readily discovered
that something serious had happened while
he was wrapped in slumber.</p>

<p>"What has been goin' on?" he asked, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Nothing much," Dan replied, with a forced
laugh. "The goat walked over us, and we're kinder
used up, that's all. Are you ready to go to breakfast?"<span class="pagenum">[67]</span></p>

<p>It was evident that Sam did not believe this explanation,
but since he said nothing more about it,
the two actors in the previous night's adventures
held their peace; therefore it would not be in his
power to betray any secrets.</p>

<p>Breakfast was eaten at an early hour, and the
young fakirs returned to the grounds in time for
Teddy to meet the first visitors.</p>

<p>Under Dan's instructions he continued to cry out:</p>

<p>"Here's where you can get a cane or a knife for
nothing! Three rings for five cents, and every
time you throw it over the mark you get what you
ring! Three for five, and every cane or knife you
ring is yours!"</p>

<p>It was yet too early for the exhibits to be opened,
therefore Teddy had the assistance of his friends in
reclaiming the rings thrown, and after nearly four
dollars had been taken in with a loss only of a ten
cent cane, the amateur fakir began to understand
that it would be necessary for him to have a
clerk.</p>

<p>"You're bound to do a good business this week,"
Dan said, at about eight o'clock. "Sam and I must
go now to attend to our own work, an' if you see
some fellow who can be trusted, I advise you to
hire him, or there'll be considerable trade lost, for
when these people want to spend their money they
won't wait for you to hunt up assistants."</p>

<p>"Yes, I reckon there's more'n a thousand who<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
are jest aching to see how I can row in one of them
dandy boats," Master Sam added; "but if you get
into any kind of a scrape, an' don't know how to
get out, come to me. I'll see you through, no matter
how good business is."</p>

<p>These two friends and advisers had hardly left
him when a particular chum from the Run came
up, and knowing he could be trusted, Teddy immediately
made a trade for his services.</p>

<p>Tim Jones accepted the offer of ten cents on each
dollar which might be taken in, and straightway
engaged himself as Teddy's clerk, promising faithfully
to account for every penny he should receive.</p>

<p>"I know you are honest," the proprietor of the
board said to his friend, "and I want you to help
me on the square, so I'm willing to give a fair price,
for I may have to be away a good deal of the time."</p>

<p>"You mean that Nathan Hargreaves is goin' to
have you arrested?"</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

<p>"Because he's tellin' around town at the Run
that you know who robbed his store, an' says he'll
have a warrant out, if he has to go to Waterville
for it."</p>

<p>"That is where he's making a great big mistake,
Tim; but if he should do anything of the kind I expect
you to do your best here," and Teddy spoke
very solemnly, for he really believed his uncle<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
would succeed in having him arrested. "I don't
know positively who broke into his store; but Dan
an' I heard enough last night to make us believe
we can find the thieves if we have time to work it
out."</p>

<p>"I'd let him hustle to get the stuff, if it was my
pudding," Tim replied with emphasis, and then as
a party of young fellows bent on spending money
approached the board he began to cry, as lustily as
might have been expected from any old fakir:</p>

<p>"Here's where you get 'em, three rings for a
nickel, and every cane or knife you ring is yours;
all for the small sum of five cents!"</p>

<p>Convinced that he had a capable clerk, who was
willing to work hard in order to earn an additional
percentage, Teddy contented himself with making
change for the rush of customers, which continued
unabated until nearly ten o'clock and then came a
lull, when he was able to watch the other fakirs
around him.</p>

<p>Up to this point business had continued in the
most promising manner, and if it held out as well
there would be no difficulty in his paying all the
money he owed, even although there might be no
very large profit.</p>

<p>"I only want to get out square," he said to himself,
while nursing his injured ear; but this experience
led him to believe it was possible to do very
much toward helping his mother, and already had<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
he begun to dream of large returns, despite the fifteen
dollars out of which he had been swindled.</p>

<p>It was just when his customers had gone to other
parts of the ground, and after Teddy had figured
up the amount of money taken in, showing that there
was nearly eight dollars in the treasury with an
offset only of one twenty-cent knife and two ten-cent
canes lost, that the young fakir saw Hazelton
standing some distance away beckoning to
him.</p>

<p>"Look out sharp for things, Tim," he cried, as he
vaulted over the railing and ran to the side of the
man whom he believed to be a friend.</p>

<p>"Did anything happen last night?" the latter
asked.</p>

<p>Teddy told him the whole story, keeping back not
one incident.</p>

<p>"I heard quite so much in the hotel where I
board. It is Long Jim and his partner who have
done the job of which both you and I are accused.
As for your uncle, he isn't worth a minute's
thought; but I'm going to get to work, an' what he
says may go against me, so you and I must turn
those fellows up if we can."</p>

<p>"Ain't your business honest?" Teddy asked, in
surprise.</p>

<p>"Well, when we come right down to dots, I don't
suppose it is. Watch me when I leave here, and
you'll have a chance to judge for yourself. I may<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
want to leave my satchel with you for a while, and
I reckon you're willing to take care of it?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am. I'll do anything you ask."</p>

<p>"Better wait and see the game first, but don't
forget that we've got to turn up the two men who
whipped you and your friend last night, or stand
the chance of being hauled up for the robbery ourselves."</p>

<p>"Did you say anything to Uncle Nathan to make
him think you would break into his store?"</p>

<p>"No; I only played him for a jay, as you shall see
me do with two or three hundred of these smart
fellows here, and he jumped down on me because
there was no one else on whom to fasten the crime.
I've got to go, now. Don't forget to hurry back to
your cane-board when you see I'm getting through
with my first stand, for I want to leave my stuff
with somebody whom I can trust."</p>

<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>THE JEWELRY FAKIR.</i></p>

<p>Teddy's curiosity regarding the kind of business
which Hazelton proposed to do was so great that,
for the time being, he forgot his own venture in
watching this supposed friend.</p>

<p>The jewelry fakir disappeared amid the crowd for
a few moments, reappearing in a carriage drawn
by a fancifully decorated horse, and the gaudy
trappings caused the sightseers to stop, believing
something interesting or curious was to be seen.</p>

<p>Hazelton introduced himself as an agent for a
large manufacturing company, and proposed to dispose
of "samples" of their goods in a manner which
would be satisfactory to all. He began by throwing
away great numbers of cheap rings made to imitate
gold, and as the boys scrambled for them he complained
that the older members of the throng&mdash;those
people whom he particularly wished should test the
merits of his wares&mdash;were getting nothing.</p>

<p>"I can change that," he said, after hesitating a
moment, as if to devise some plan. Then holding
up half a dozen pairs of cuff-buttons, he continued:<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
"I am allowed to give away only six of these.
What gentleman will advance twenty-five cents for
one of these sets, knowing the money will be returned
to him? By that means I shall place the
goods where they will do the most good."</p>

<p>In a short time the necessary number of purchasers
was found, each having paid a quarter of a dollar,
and then, with great ostentation, the fakir returned
to every one the money he had given.</p>

<p>A similar performance was gone through with in
the case of ten seal rings, and by that time the
crowd were in a state of high excitement, for they
were getting supposedly valuable goods by simply
loaning this agent their money for a short time.</p>

<p>The fakir then held up a lot of watch-chains, asking
who would give him a dollar for one, but in this
instance he made no mention of returning the
money.</p>

<p>Believing these also were to be given away, every
man scrambled to pass up his dollar before the supply
should be exhausted, and fully two hundred
dollars was taken in by the generous "agent."
Then, as the demand ceased, Hazelton produced
from his valise what appeared to be a heavy gold
watch.</p>

<p>Wrapping it in paper, and attaching it to a chain,
he cried:</p>

<p>"Who wants to take another, and receive as a
present what I have fastened to the end of it; but<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
on the condition that this paper shall not be removed
until I give permission?"</p>

<p>A young fellow standing near Teddy made all
possible haste to pass the fakir a dollar and receive
the prize.</p>

<p>Then the remainder of the crowd clamored for
more to be put up in the same manner, and Hazelton
disposed of at least a hundred before the
clamorous throng could be appeased.</p>

<p>While this was being done Teddy saw the young
fellow slyly remove the paper and examine his
goods. A look of anger and disappointment overspread
his face as a cheap, empty locket, fashioned
on the outside something like the case of a watch,
was revealed to view. Twenty cents would have
been an extravagantly high price for what he had
paid a dollar; but it was possible the agent would
return the money as he had done in the previous
cases, and the victimized fellow held his peace.</p>

<p>Hazelton was now ready to take a hurried departure.
No more dollars were passed up, and quickly
seizing the reins, he said:</p>

<p>"I have not represented these goods to be gold;
but they are a fine imitation, and Mr. Nathan Hargreaves,
of Peach Bottom Run, will probably act as
my agent for the sale of them. You can get what
may be wanted from him if you need any more."</p>

<p>The last words were hardly spoken before he
drove quickly through the throng, leaving his dupes<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
in a daze, from which they did not recover until he
was lost to view.</p>

<p>Now Teddy understood what the "Give-Away"
game was, and he also knew that it was far from
being honest, although Hazelton had really made
no promises which he did not fulfill.</p>

<p>Some of the victims were angry, and vowed to
flog "that feller within an inch of his life" before
sunset; others bore their loss philosophically, and
turned away with the remark that the fakir was "a
cute one," while the majority hastened off lest they
should be suspected of being victims.</p>

<p>Teddy returned to his cane-board feeling sad because
he had been so mistaken in this particular
man, and had hardly reached there when Hazelton,
on foot, came from the side of the fair grounds opposite
where he had disappeared, saying hurriedly,
as he handed the boy a black satchel somewhat resembling
a sample case:</p>

<p>"Look out for this! All my money is in it."</p>

<p>Without waiting for an answer the man was
gone, and the young fakir was in no slight distress
at being the custodian of so much wealth.</p>

<p>After considerable discussion with Tim he decided
to leave it behind the cane-board where it
would be screened from view, and then a crowd of
customers suddenly appearing, he was so busy during
the next half hour that he hardly had time to
think of that which had been intrusted to his keeping.<span class="pagenum">[76]</span></p>

<p>Not until trade grew dull once more did Hazelton
appear, looking decidedly well pleased with himself,
and, standing where the passers-by could not
hear, he asked:</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of the give-away game
now?"</p>

<p>"It looks to me like a swindle," Teddy replied,
bluntly. "The things you sold were not worth half
what you got for them."</p>

<p>"Six cents apiece for the chains, and five for the
lockets is what I pay by the quantity," the fakir
said, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"But you made the people think they were getting
real watches."</p>

<p>"I was mighty careful to say nothing of the kind.
They thought they saw a watch, and I told them I
would make each purchaser a present of what was
on the chain. Their idea was to get the best of me,
and in that I didn't lose very much. It's a case of
setting a thief to catch a thief, and the smartest
man comes out ahead."</p>

<p>"But why did you leave all the money with me?"</p>

<p>"Because it sometimes happens that my customers
make a kick, and try to get back their stuff by
force, so I don't carry much cash in my pockets
while I am on the fair grounds."</p>

<p>"Of course you are all through now. You can't
expect to do the same thing over again."</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I shall do in about an hour<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>,
only in a different portion of the inclosure, and
you'll see that I can catch just as many suckers
as before."</p>

<p>Then, in order to be rid of the satchel, for it
seemed as if he was really concerned in the swindle
so long as it remained in his keeping, Teddy
said he wanted to see what Dan and Sam were
doing.</p>

<p>"Go ahead; I'll stay near by where I can keep an
eye on the stuff, so you needn't let that worry you."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the boy was not eager to
leave his place of business; but having said so, it
was necessary to go, or let Hazelton understand
exactly why the remark had been made.</p>

<p>Cautioning Tim to "keep his eyes open for trade,"
he walked across the grounds to the building where
Dan was employed, and found that young gentleman
displaying the good qualities of a peculiar-looking
weapon.</p>

<p>"This is the Model Pocket Rifle," Dan was saying
to a party of gentlemen. "The shoulder-rest is detachable,
and you can buy an effective weapon for
a trifle over fifteen dollars, as&mdash;&mdash; Hello, Teddy,
how's business?" he added, suddenly, on observing
his friend, and the two had an opportunity for conversation,
while the curious ones were examining
the rifle.</p>

<p>Teddy gave a brief account of what had already
been done, and then asked:<span class="pagenum">[78]</span></p>

<p>"Can't you get off a few minutes and go with me
to see what Sam is doing?"</p>

<p>It was not difficult for Dan to get a short leave of
absence, and the two went directly to the creek
where their acquaintance, who proposed to make
himself the central figure of the fair, was rowing
around in a jaunty looking craft.</p>

<p>Sam wore a sailor's shirt, turned away at the
throat, and tied with a black silk handkerchief,
while on the breast of the garment was worked
the name "Davis Boat and Oar Co., Detroit, Mich."
The same legend being printed in gold on the band
of his straw hat.</p>

<p>Sam had evidently been expecting his friends, for
he espied them before they reached the shore, and,
rowing to the bank, insisted they should take a sail.</p>

<p>"Come on, it's all right," he said. "It don't make
any difference whether I carry passengers or not so
long as the boat is kept goin', an' I want to show
you somethin' fine in the way of rowin'."</p>

<p>Neither of the boys cared very much about accepting
the invitation; but he was so persistent
that they finally stepped on board as the easiest
manner of settling the matter.</p>

<p>"I tell you what it is, fellers," he said, as he
pulled out into the stream, "I'm jest makin' things
hum around here. These folks have never seen any
kind of style put into rowin', an' I'm knockin' their
eyes out."<span class="pagenum">[79]</span></p>

<p>"Don't give it to them too strong, or they may
want to keep you here as an ornament after the fair
closes, and then the rest of the world would suffer,"
Dan said, with a laugh, and Sam replied:</p>

<p>"You fellers can make fun; but what I say is
straight," and then he made preparations for giving
an exhibition. "Watch me now, an' you'll learn a
thing or two about boats."</p>

<p>During the next ten minutes he pulled as if in a
race, first up and then down the stream, until sheer
lack of breath forced him to stop.</p>

<p>"I hope you haven't set the keel on fire," Dan
said, solicitously. "There's no question but that
you made good time, though I'm inclined to think
the build of the boat had considerable to do with the
speed. This one looks as if she would row herself."</p>

<p>"That's all you know about it. If I hadn't been a
first-class hand at&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"See there!" Teddy cried, excitedly, as he pointed
toward the shore. "That's the man who got my
fifteen dollars. Pull in, Sam, an' pull for all you
are worth!"</p>

<p>The oarsman delayed only long enough to gaze in
the direction indicated, where he saw the old fakir
whom they had met with such great loss at Waterville,
and then he bent himself to the task.</p>

<p>"Do you believe it will be safe to tackle him after
last night?" Dan asked.</p>

<p>"I'm going to, and if he don't get away from me<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
I'll ask some of the crowd to help me have him arrested,"
Teddy replied, grimly.</p>

<p>The little craft was a considerable distance from
the shore. Sam was so excited that he only thought
of landing in the shortest possible space of time,
and instead of keeping a lookout for other boats,
rowed vigorously, as if he were the only oarsman on
the stream.</p>

<p>Teddy and Dan sat motionless, with their eyes
fixed on the man, and thus it happened that no one
on board saw a double ender, in which were three
ladies and two gentlemen, come around a bend in
the creek directly in Sam's course.</p>

<p>There was a shout from the bank, three shrill
screams of terror, and then a crash as the two
craft came together with terrific force.</p>

<p>The occupants of both boats were thrown into the
water as the frail timbers were splintered, and the
spectators on the bank acted as if panic-stricken.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>A BRAVE RESCUE.</i></p>

<p>Sam was a fairly good swimmer, and as soon as
he found himself in the water he struck out for
the shore, paying no attention to any one else until
he had assured his own safety.</p>

<p>One of the gentlemen in the other craft did the
same selfish thing, while the other, unable to help
even himself, was trying to keep his head above
water by resting his chin on an oar and piece of
planking.</p>

<p>The women were in imminent danger of being
drowned, for there was no other boat near at hand
which could be sent to the rescue, and the throng of
spectators was in that unreasoning state of fear
and excitement which prevents people from being
of any service at such a time.</p>

<p>When Teddy and Dan came to the surface after
having been thrown from their seats, they were
within a few feet of each other, and the latter
asked:</p>

<p>"Can you swim?"</p>

<p>"Yes; don't pay any attention to me, but do
what you can toward saving those women."<span class="pagenum">[82]</span></p>

<p>"Will you help me?"</p>

<p>"Of course; but I can't take care of more than
one."</p>

<p>Both boats had disappeared, and nothing save
a few fragments showed where they had gone
down.</p>

<p>Teddy thought only of aiding the struggling
women, for there was no question that the man
with the oar could take care of himself, at least
until those on the bank should be sufficiently composed
to do something effective, and he swam to
the nearest struggling being, clasping her firmly
under one arm as he said:</p>

<p>"Don't make a row; but keep perfectly quiet, an'
I'll take you ashore."</p>

<p>Half-unconscious as she was, the woman attempted
to grasp him by the neck, and for several
seconds he had all he could do to prevent her from
choking him to death; but after two or three kicks
judiciously administered, he succeeded in making
her understand that her life as well as his own depended
upon her remaining passive, and from that
moment all went well.</p>

<p>The employees of the company which had the
boats on exhibition flung into the water several life-saving
arrangements of cork and canvas, and by
dint of much persuading he induced her to trust to
one of these while he went to the assistance of Dan,
who had been carried beneath the surface more<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
than once by the struggles of the woman whom
he was trying to save.</p>

<p>By this time a boat was brought up from around
the point, and as these two helpless ones were taken
on board both the boys swam to the rescue of the
last of the party who had sunk beneath the surface
for the third time.</p>

<p>Teddy, now nearly exhausted by his efforts, was
the first to grasp her; but if it had not been for Dan
the struggle would have been useless, since his
strength was so far spent that he could not have
brought her above the water unaided.</p>

<p>By their united efforts, however, she was taken
on board the boat in a state of unconsciousness,
and they made their way to the shore cheered by
the shouts of the assembled multitude.</p>

<p>Weak, almost exhausted beyond the power to
stand upright, they landed a few seconds in advance
of the craft, and the reception received was
enough to have nerved stronger men to a semblance
of strength.</p>

<p>It was not until they were in the private apartments
allotted to the Davis Company that either
fully understood how weak he was, and then willing
hands aided them to recuperate.</p>

<p>Hot flannels, warm drinks, and dry clothes were
contributed by the different exhibitors, until, as
Teddy said, they looked like "circus clowns;" but
they were in fairly good bodily condition, and it<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
appeared as if the involuntary bath had done them
no real injury.</p>

<p>Outside the building the people were shouting
themselves hoarse in praise of the two boys who
had saved three lives, and Sam stood bowing
acknowledgments as if he had been the chief actor
in the thrilling scene.</p>

<p>The difference between the real and the pretended
life-savers was readily understood, however,
when Dan and Teddy made their appearance, looking
decidedly the worse for their struggles, and
the cheers which went up would have been ample
reward for the most praise-loving person in the
world.</p>

<p>They looked like anything rather than reputable
employees as they appeared in the borrowed garments;
but as Teddy said, they couldn't stay in the
building until their clothes were dried, and it was
absolutely necessary he should attend to his business.</p>

<p>Dan's duties necessitated his remaining near the
creek; but Teddy was forced to go back to his cane-board,
and the crowd which followed him was good
evidence of the money he would make.</p>

<p>During two hours after he returned from this
thrilling adventure the cane-board had more customers
than could conveniently be attended to,
and it is safe to say that he then handled a larger
amount than he had ever before seen.<span class="pagenum">[85]</span></p>

<p>"At this rate it won't take long to square up
things, and you shall have a fair portion of the
profits, Tim," he said, when there was an opportunity
for him to speak with his clerk without being
overheard by the customers.</p>

<p>"It's a lucky thing for us that them boats were
smashed," Tim said, devoutly, as he handed his
employer half a dollar to change. "We might
have stood here with our tongues hangin' out all
day an' never seen a quarter of this money if you
hadn't known how to swim."</p>

<p>"You are right to a certain extent; but I can't
take all the credit of this spurt, because more than
half the people are trying to get a cane for nothing."</p>

<p>"In the same way they thought to swindle Mr.
Hazelton out of a watch," Tim replied, with a smile;
"but we won't fight about what brings trade so
long as it comes with the cash."</p>

<p>Up to this time Teddy had no very definite idea
of how much money had been taken in, and he was
thinking it would be a good idea to ascertain, when
a gruff, familiar voice from the rear asked:</p>

<p>"Are the wages of sin as much as they should
be?"</p>

<p>Turning quickly he saw Uncle Nathan, and
replied:</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly what they should be; but,
perhaps, you do."<span class="pagenum">[86]</span></p>

<p>"Whatever I may know now, I remember that
it was not allowed I should insult my elders either
by plainly spoken words or insinuations," the old
man said, sternly.</p>

<p>"Neither would I have done such a thing if you
had not given me the provocation; but when I
promised to pay three dollars for the use of fifteen
one week, you did not seem to think that amount
would be the wages of sin."</p>

<p>"At the time I had no idea you would conspire
with others to rob me of my hard-earned savings."</p>

<p>"You know very well, Uncle Nathan, that I
haven't done any such thing. On the night your
store was robbed I staid in the house, and hadn't
left it when you came to tell us the news."</p>

<p>"Every person of your class has some such
excuse ready in case of an emergency; but that
kind of talk will not do with me. If you meant to
do the square thing, why was I not told you lost
the money I lent you?"</p>

<p>"Because I knew you would raise an awful row,
thinking possibly it would not be paid back."</p>

<p>"Have I yet any assurance that it will be?" the
old man asked, in a fury.</p>

<p>"Do you need it now?"</p>

<p>"I always need my own."</p>

<p>"And in this case, if I pay you at once, do you
think it right to charge me three dollars for the
use of fifteen lent two days ago?"<span class="pagenum">[87]</span></p>

<p>"That was what you promised, and the world
gauges a man by the way he keeps his word."</p>

<p>"I owe the storekeeper in Waterville thirty dollars;
but I told him you must be paid first, and so
you shall."</p>

<p>"Then give me the money now," Uncle Nathan
snarled.</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I am willing to do," Teddy
replied, calmly; "but if you can't trust me I have
reason to be suspicious of you, so give me a receipt
for the amount, and the matter can be settled."</p>

<p>The old man literally glared at his nephew for an
instant, and then, eager to have the cash in his
possession, he wrote a receipt, handing it to the
young fakir, as he said, angrily:</p>

<p>"Now, let me see if you can settle the bill."</p>

<p>Since the mishap on the creek, where Teddy had
covered himself with glory, business had been so
good that he had more than twice that amount,
and, emptying the contents of his money bag on a
board, he proceeded to select the required sum.</p>

<p>Uncle Nathan watched him jealously, his eyes
twinkling enviously, and when the money was
placed in his hand he counted it twice over before
delivering up the written acknowledgment.</p>

<p>"Are you certain all this has been honestly
earned, Teddy?" he asked, gravely.</p>

<p>"How else could I have got it?"</p>

<p>"There are many ways. While I would not be<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
willing to take my oath to it, several of these ten-cent
pieces look very much like those I lost night
before last."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say I had anything to do with
robbing your store?" and now that this particular
debt had been canceled Teddy felt very brave.</p>

<p>"I know that such an amount of money has not
been earned honestly, and, what is more, my eyes
have been opened to the character of your friends."</p>

<p>"If you mean Mr. Hazelton, he is as much your
friend as mine, for you were with him all day Sunday."</p>

<p>"That is exactly who I do mean," Uncle Nathan
replied, with provoking deliberation. "I have seen
his method of doing business since I came into this
fair, and know he is nothing more than a deliberate
swindler."</p>

<p>"But one with whom you were perfectly willing
to go into partnership," a voice in the rear of Teddy
cried sharply, and the jewelry fakir stepped directly
in front of Uncle Nathan. "I told you exactly
how I worked, and you offered to put up even
money with me, growing angry when I said you
would be of no use in the business. If it is swindling,
you were mighty eager to have a hand in the
same business."</p>

<p>"I don't want to talk with you," Uncle Nathan
said, as he put Teddy's eighteen dollars carefully
in his pocket.<span class="pagenum">[89]</span></p>

<p>"Then why do you come around here trying to
bully this boy? He had no idea of what I was
going to do until he saw me work, while you understood
the whole plan. Make any trouble for him,
and I will get up here and tell every person who
comes along that you wanted to be my partner."</p>

<p>"Do it," the old man said, angrily. "After having
cheated so many people out of their money,
who will believe a word you say?"</p>

<p>At the same time, however, Uncle Nathan took
good care to leave this particular spot, and Hazelton
stepped to the rear of the board where he could
talk privately with Teddy.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>AN ENCOUNTER.</i></p>

<p>First of all, the jewelry fakir wanted to hear the
particulars of the accident on the lake, and
Teddy began by telling him the primary cause of the
trouble.</p>

<p>"I reckon all three of us lost our heads when we
saw that man; I know I did and we were so eager
to get on shore that we paid no attention to anything
else. Have you seen him?"</p>

<p>"Who? Long Jim? No; but the boys say he is
here somewhere running the swinging ball game."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"A wooden ball is swung on two short uprights
about eight inches apart, and between them, in the
center, stands a small peg. You pay ten cents for
the privilege of swinging the ball, and if it hits the
peg when it comes back after leaving your hand,
you get a dollar."</p>

<p>"I should think that would be easy enough to do."</p>

<p>"Well, don't try it with such an idea or you'll go
broke mighty quick. It looks simple; but it isn't
accomplished very often."<span class="pagenum">[91]</span></p>

<p>"Have you done anything since I left here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and scooped in as much as I had any right
to expect. I don't want to spoil to-morrow's business,
so sha'n't make another pitch, but will spend
my time trying to find Jim."</p>

<p>"What good can that do?"</p>

<p>"I still count on making him give back your
fifteen dollars, if nothing more. I reckon your
Uncle Nathan won't try again to get a warrant out
for us, and so I sha'n't bother my head about learning
anything regarding the robbery."</p>

<p>"He'll make things just as disagreeable as he
can; there's no question about that."</p>

<p>"Well, let him, and we'll see who comes out
ahead. Trade is beginning to pick up, and you'd
better attend to your customers."</p>

<p>Hazelton walked away, and from that moment
until nearly nightfall Teddy had all the business
both he and his clerk could attend to.</p>

<p>Nearly every one had something to say about the
accident on the creek, and the young fakir was
forced to tell the story over and over again, until
he really got tired of repeating the details.</p>

<p>When nearly all of the visitors had left the
grounds Teddy made up his cash account, and the
sum total surprised both himself and Tim.</p>

<p>Including the amount paid Uncle Nathan he had
taken in fifty-five dollars and twenty cents. Ten
per cent. of this was paid to the clerk, and he found<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
himself possessed of the magnificent sum of thirty-one
dollars and seventy cents.</p>

<p>"At this rate we shall be rich before the end of
the week," he said, in a tone of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"That's a fact; but it don't seem right for me
to take so much," Tim replied, as he wrapped the
five dollars and a half which had been given him
in his handkerchief.</p>

<p>"That was the agreement, an' we'll stick to it."</p>

<p>"But when you promised ten cents on every dollar
neither of us believed trade would be half so
good."</p>

<p>"You're right; I thought if we got one-third as
much business would be booming; but that has
nothing to do with our bargain. You've hung right
on here, without even stopping for anything to eat,
an' are entitled to what you've been paid. Everybody
says there'll be a bigger crowd to-morrow,
an' so we stand a chance to make considerable
more. Are you going home to-night, or do you
count on staying here?"</p>

<p>"I've got to let the folks know where I am, for
when I left it was allowed I'd be back by sunset.
To-morrow I'll come prepared to stay the rest of
the week."</p>

<p>"There'll be plenty of stages running, an' you
can afford to ride both ways after this day's work.
I want to send some of this money home to mother,
for it ain't safe to carry so much around with me."<span class="pagenum">[93]</span></p>

<p>"Am I to take it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, an' you can tell her all that has happened.
Ask her to come over Thursday, an' see for herself
that we're getting rich."</p>

<p>Twenty-five dollars was tied in a bundle with
many wrappings of paper, and Tim started off,
looking almost afraid at being the custodian of so
much wealth.</p>

<p>It was necessary Teddy should pack up his entire
stock until next morning, and this he proceeded to
do as soon as he was alone. Mr. Sweet had given
him permission to bring his goods into the museum
tent, and his only trouble was how everything
could be carried without assistance. Before he was
ready for departure, however, Sam came up, and
the question of transportation was settled.</p>

<p>"Well, how do you feel now?" Teddy asked,
cheerily, for the knowledge that he had already
taken in nearly enough to pay his debts caused him
to feel very jolly.</p>

<p>"I allers get the worst of everything," Sam replied,
disconsolately. "You an' Dan made a big
strike when you tumbled into the water, an' I've
had a blowin' up; come mighty near losin' my job
into the bargain."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"'Cause the boss says that I was careless an'
reckless, an' that I couldn't earn enough in a
month to pay for the two boats I've smashed."<span class="pagenum">[94]</span></p>

<p>"Are they lost entirely?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not. We pulled 'em out a little
while ago, an' it cost so very much to fix both.
The folks in the other boat were as much to blame
as me."</p>

<p>"They certainly were not keeping any better
lookout, and, as a matter of fact, I suppose I'm
more at fault than any one else, for if I hadn't
sung out about the fakir it wouldn't have happened."</p>

<p>"That's what I told the boss; but he's chuck full
of foolish talk about the bravery he says you an'
Dan showed, an' is tryin' to get up what he calls
a testimonial for you."</p>

<p>"A what?" Teddy cried, in surprise.</p>

<p>"I heard him say testimonial; but if you know
what that means you can go to the head."</p>

<p>"I don't, and I hope it won't amount to anything.
I've been paid enough for what was done by the
boom it gave my business."</p>

<p>"Of course, you an' Dan are bound to have the
best end of it."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you stop an' do the same thing?"</p>

<p>"'Cause I had sense enough to look out for myself
first."</p>

<p>"But you know how to swim."</p>

<p>"What of that? It's mighty risky catchin' hold
of people in the water, an' I don't mean to take any
chances. How much have you made to-day?"<span class="pagenum">[95]</span></p>

<p>When Teddy told him, the expert in rowing
looked decidedly envious.</p>

<p>"You've got all that money in one day?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I sent the most of it home to mother."</p>

<p>"It's funny what luck some folks have, when
them as knows the business twice as well don't
much more'n earn their salt," Sam said, as if to
himself, and before he could continue Dan arrived.</p>

<p>He wore his own clothes, and carried those Teddy
had left in the boat-house.</p>

<p>"These were dry, so I brought 'em up. You
needn't carry back the ones you borrowed till to-morrow,
so Sam's boss says."</p>

<p>Then Dan asked concerning business, and by the
time all three had finished discussing this very important
matter the knives and canes were packed
ready for removal.</p>

<p>Each boy took a load, carried it to the tent where
Mr. Sweet was figuring up his receipts for the day,
and then went to supper, returning half an hour
later so tired that there was no desire on the part of
either to do anything other than sleep.</p>

<p>The proprietor of the museum was in very good
spirits. He had taken in one hundred and six dollars
and eighty cents, and said, in a tone of satisfaction:</p>

<p>"I reckon this fair will pan out all right. Trade
is bound to be better to-morrow, and Thursday is
always the biggest of the week. I hear you boys<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
have been distinguishing yourselves. Tell me about
it."</p>

<p>Dan related the incident of the day very modestly,
interrupted now and then by Sam, who was
eager to pose as a hero also, and Mr. Sweet expressed
himself as being well satisfied with their
behavior.</p>

<p>"Chasing a thief and getting a whipping in the
night, and then saving the lives of three people
the next day is record enough for one week, so
you'd better not try for any more adventures," he
said, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Now that the incident of the previous night had
been spoken of so openly, it was necessary Sam's
curiosity should be satisfied, and Dan was forced
to tell the story.</p>

<p>While he was doing so, and listening to the oarsman's
comments, Teddy had an opportunity to see
the "barker" and clown who arrived that morning.
Neither was a very prepossessing-looking man.
They were lying on the ground some distance from
the boys, as if bent on minding their own business,
and there was no real reason for an unfavorable
opinion concerning them.</p>

<p>But little time was spent in conversation on this
evening. Every one was thoroughly tired, and each
sought for a soft spot on which to pass the night.</p>

<p>As before, Sam crawled up on the wagon to be
out of harm's way when the goat should be unfastened,<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
while Dan and Teddy lay down in very
nearly the same place as before.</p>

<p>"I don't fancy we shall hear many secrets
between now and morning, no matter how many
men come around here to talk," the former said,
laughingly. "It won't take me two minutes to fall
asleep, and the noise that can awaken me then will
have to be very great."</p>

<p>Teddy's only reply was a yawn, and in even less
time than Dan had mentioned he was wrapped in
slumber.</p>

<p>Shortly after the proprietor of the exhibition
began to make his preparations for retiring, and
the clown asked:</p>

<p>"How did that row start this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Half a dozen of the village toughs tried to get in
without paying, and I had to polish one of 'em off,"
the barker replied.</p>

<p>"You must have done it pretty quick, for when I
got out there the thing was over," Mr. Sweet said.</p>

<p>"The fellow was more than half-drunk, an' it
wasn't a very big job. They threaten to come back
and clean the whole show out."</p>

<p>"Yes, I've heard such threats made before; but
never lost much sleep worrying about it."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later all the human occupants of the
tent were enjoying a well-earned rest, and the goat
had about concluded it would be a profitless job to
prospect for anything more to eat, when the sound<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
of footsteps could have been heard from the outside.</p>

<p>Had Mr. Sweet been awake he would have decided
that these late visitors were trying to find the
flap of the tent, for they walked cautiously around
the canvas twice, and then a sharp knife was thrust
through the fabric.</p>

<p>An instant later Sam awoke his companion with
a yell that would have done credit to any Indian.</p>

<p>Some one had given him such a blow as sent him
from the seat to the ground, and the remainder of
the party leaped to their feet only to be confronted
by a large party of half-drunken toughs who had
come to avenge the insult received during the afternoon.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>LONG JIM</i>.</p>

<p>Teddy's first thought when he was awakened by
Sam's yells was that the officers of the law were
coming to arrest him for the robbery committed at
Uncle Nathan's store; but in a very few seconds he
understood that this was not the case.</p>

<p>He and Dan had been sleeping some distance
from the remainder of the company; therefore,
when the hand-to-hand struggle began they were
out of it entirely, and owing to the darkness could
not be seen by the assailants; but Sam's cries
served to show the mob where he was, and one after
another pounded him when they failed to find any
of the other occupants.</p>

<p>While one might have counted twenty Teddy and
Dan stood motionless, undecided as to what should
be done, while the din caused by the combatants
and the screaming boy were almost deafening, and
then the latter said:</p>

<p>"We've got to take a hand in this row, Teddy.
Mr. Sweet has given us the chance to sleep here,
and the least we can do is to help as much as possible,<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
for it appears to me that his men are getting
the worst of it."</p>

<p>A broken tent-peg was lying on the ground near
at hand, and Dan added, as he seized it:</p>

<p>"Try to light one of the lanterns so we can see
which is an enemy, and then sail in."</p>

<p>It seemed to Teddy as if he would never be able
to follow these instructions. He had plenty of
matches; but in his excitement one after another
was extinguished until he fancied half an hour
must have elapsed before the wick was ignited.</p>

<p>The faint glow of light served to show one of the
intruders Teddy's form, and the latter had but just
succeeded in hanging the lantern on the center-pole
when it became necessary to defend himself.</p>

<p>The drunken bully made a lunge at him, which
he managed to avoid by jumping aside, and in another
instant he had seized the man by the waist,
doing his best to throw him.</p>

<p>From this moment Teddy knew nothing more of
the row than that portion in which he was immediately
concerned. He was able to prevent the man
from striking by hugging close to his body, and the
two swayed here and there in the effort to gain the
mastery. Now and then they came in contact with
the other combatants, one or both receiving a
chance blow, but no especial injury was done to
either.</p>

<p>Had the man been sober, Teddy must have been<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
overcome in a very short time; but as he was far
from being steady on his feet the odds were about
even, and the boy succeeded in holding his own until
the others had retreated or been so disabled that
it was no longer possible for them to continue the
assault.</p>

<p>Fully thirty minutes had elapsed from the time
Sam first sounded the alarm before the occupants of
the tent could count themselves as victors, and then
Mr. Sweet and the clown pulled Teddy's adversary
away, throwing him bodily out of the tent after administering
summary punishment.</p>

<p>During all this time the other exhibitors who intended
to sleep on the grounds had been gathering
around the canvas, but no one cared to risk his
precious body by entering until it was certain the
battle had been ended.</p>

<p>Then the tent was filled with sympathizing
friends, who endeavored to ascertain the amount of
injury done, but were interrupted in the work by
the proprietor, who cried, angrily:</p>

<p>"Clear out of here, every mother's son! You
didn't dare to come in when it would have been
possible to help us, and there's no need of you now.
We were attacked by a crowd of men from the
town, who proposed to clean the show out because
we wouldn't let them in free, and that's all there is
to it."</p>

<p>Not until the last visitor had unwillingly departed<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
did the little party pay any attention to their
wounds, and then the result of the engagement was
ascertained.</p>

<p>The barker had a broken nose, but it would not
prevent him from doing a full share of talking on
the following day. The clown's eye looked rather
bad, and Mr. Sweet's cheek had been cut, but these
were only trifling mishaps. Teddy had come out of
the affray comparatively uninjured; Dan showed
nothing worse than a bruise under the left ear, and
while Sam appeared to be unscathed, he declared
that he had been pounded until every inch of his
body felt like jelly.</p>

<p>"You squealed fairly well for a fellow who was
so badly done up," Mr. Sweet said, with a laugh, as
he proceeded to dress the barker's wounded nose,
"and I reckon you'll be all right by morning. Light
some of the other lanterns so I can see what I'm
about, and during the remainder of the night we'll
stand guard, for no one can say how soon those
scoundrels may attempt to pay us a second visit,
although I think they had a full dose this
time."</p>

<p>How the assailants had fared no one was able to
form a very good opinion. The general belief
among the occupants of the tent, however, was
that they had received such severe punishment that
there would be no further attack on this night, at
least.<span class="pagenum">[103]</span></p>

<p>When the wounds had been dressed, Mr. Sweet
said, as he took up a position near the flap:</p>

<p>"You fellows had better try to go to sleep now.
I'll keep awake for a while, and then call some one
to relieve me. Dan, can't you borrow one of those
queer-looking rifles you are exhibiting, and bring
it with you to-morrow night?"</p>

<p>"I might get the one I use for shooting at a target;
but you wouldn't think of trying to kill a man,
would you, Mr. Sweet?"</p>

<p>"I could do a good deal toward scaring them, and
if a crowd insisted on forcing an entrance, I'd take
mighty good care that one would carry away a bullet
to remember me by."</p>

<p>"I'll bring the rifle," Dan replied, and Teddy
whispered:</p>

<p>"When I came here to run a cane-board I didn't
count on being obliged to do any fighting."</p>

<p>"I don't reckon there'll be much more here. The
managers of the fair will see to it that those fellows
are put where they can't do any additional mischief,
for the exhibitors must be protected, and we
shall be safe enough, except something else comes
up to make a row."</p>

<p>Then the sore, tired party lay down in search of
slumber once more, and, strange as it may seem
after the exciting events, all save the sentinel were
soon wrapped again in slumber.</p>

<p>Each in turn was aroused to do his share of<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
guard duty before morning came; but no enemy
appeared, and at sunrise the three boys went across
the grounds to the boarding-house, where, as Dan
said: "The price was twice as big as the breakfast."</p>

<p>Teddy had his place of business ready for the reception
of customers before the first stage-load of
visitors arrived, and when Tim came he had already
taken in nearly a dollar.</p>

<p>"What's the news?" he asked, as the clerk appeared,
looking radiant and happy at the thought of
earning as much money as on the previous day.</p>

<p>"Your mother was pretty nigh wild when I told
her what we took in yesterday, an' says she'll be
here sure on Thursday. There's no more news of
your Uncle Nathan's goods, an' he's still tryin' to
have you arrested; but your mother says not to be
afraid, 'cause she has talked with a lawyer, an'
don't think there'll be any trouble. I told the folks
at home that the old skinflint made you pay three
dollars interest on the money what was stole, an'
everybody in town will know it before night."</p>

<p>Tim was forced to stop his story to wait upon a
party of young gentlemen who were eager to get
dollar canes for five cents, and the booths adjoining
Teddy's place of business had not yet been
opened when he announced that there were four
dollars in the money box.</p>

<p>"We're bound to have a big day," Tim said, confidently.<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
"The band from the Run is comin' over this
mornin', an' if the city people hear about it you bet
they'll jest crowd in to hear the music. There'll be
[&mdash;&mdash;] of the boys to see you, but take my advice
an' don't let 'em have any rings on credit, for I
wouldn't trust the best of the whole lot at fair time.
I'm goin' to stay till Friday; do you s'pose that
man will let me sleep in his tent with you fellers?"</p>

<p>Teddy promised to inquire, and then advised Tim
to have a look at the grounds before business began
to be rushing, and the clerk was glad to take advantage
of the proposition.</p>

<p>He started off with the air of one who owned the
entire inclosure, and was hardly lost to view amid
the fast-gathering throng when Teddy was literally
dazed by seeing Long Jim, the very man who
had robbed him in Waterville, lounging along toward
his stand.</p>

<p>Not until the fakir stood directly in front of the
boy did he appear to recognize him, and then he
would have turned quickly away but for the latter's
cry:</p>

<p>"Somebody hold that man till I get a constable!
He stole my money."</p>

<p>Realizing that a flight across the grounds with
hundreds of men and boys crying "Stop thief!" in
full pursuit would be disastrous, Long Jim turned
to face his young accuser.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by saying such a thing?" he<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
asked, angrily. "If you wasn't so small I'd make
you eat the words."</p>

<p>"I was big enough for you to steal from, and I
want my money."</p>

<p>It was only natural that a crowd should gather
after such an accusation, and Long Jim looked
around for some means of escape, but, realizing
that he could not well get away while so many were
near, he stepped close to Teddy, as he whispered:</p>

<p>"If you say another word I'll smash your face,
you young whelp! Hold your tongue if you want to
leave here alive."</p>

<p>"I'll say exactly what's true. Give me my
money, or I'll find some one to have you arrested!"</p>

<p>"The boy is a liar, and, what is more, has just
robbed his uncle's store, if what they say over at
the Run be true," the fakir said, excitedly, as he
turned to face the crowd. "I don't want to hurt
him; but I won't be insulted by a thief, so the best
thing for me to do is to leave."</p>

<p>Saying this, he walked deliberately away, and the
curious ones, who a moment previous had been
friendly to Teddy, began to sympathize with the
man.</p>

<p>"Don't let him off!" the boy cried, starting to follow,
and then remembering that he would be forced
to leave his wares at the mercy of the crowd, turned
back, while Long Jim continued straight across the
grounds unmolested.<span class="pagenum">[107]</span></p>

<p>"It looks like it was a case of the pot calling the
kettle black," an old farmer said, and his immediate
circle of friends laughed heartily, while the
younger portion of the crowd gazed earnestly at
Teddy, believing they saw before them a fullfledged
burglar.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>A DISCOVERY.</i></p>

<p>With feelings of mingled anger, vexation and
disappointment, Teddy stood silent and motionless
for several moments after Long Jim disappeared,
striving to keep the tears from his eyes.</p>

<p>It seemed hard enough to be swindled out of fifteen
dollars, but to be held up as a thief by the very
man who had done him the wrong, and to be stared
at as a criminal by the curious, was an aggravation
of misfortune.</p>

<p>Just for one instant he made up his mind to tell
the whole story to the bystanders, but before there
was time for him to speak he realized that many of
them would think he was trying to shield himself
by an untruth against just accusations, therefore
he remained quiet, not making the slightest effort to
influence trade.</p>

<p>Fortunately he was soon aroused from this very
disagreeable frame of mind by a very pleasing incident.</p>

<p>The band from the Run arrived, and to the young
fakir's surprise marched directly to his booth, the
leader saying, in a tone sufficiently loud to be<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
heard by every one in the immediate vicinity as
the musicians halted about ten feet away:</p>

<p>"We have been hired to play on the grounds to-day,
Teddy, and left home half an hour earlier than
the specified time for the sole purpose of giving you
a serenade to show that, whatever your uncle may
say, the folks at the Run are positive there isn't a
shadow of truth in his ridiculous story. We know
what you are working for, and intend to help you
along as much as possible."</p>

<p>Then the musicians began to play, while, as a
matter of course, every one who came up wanted to
know why the band was there instead of on the
stand built for its especial accommodation, and
there were people enough who had heard the leader's
remarks to explain matters to the newcomers.</p>

<p>The immediate result was that instead of believing
him to be a burglar, the same ones who fancied
a few moments previous that he looked guilty, were
now quite positive he was a victim.</p>

<p>Tim arrived while the serenade was in progress,
and when Teddy explained the situation, he exclaimed,
gleefully:</p>

<p>"Well, by jinks! This jest knocks the spots outer
everything! Trade will hum after this, or I'm a
duffer."</p>

<p>And the clerk's prediction was verified in a very
short time.</p>

<p>When the musicians had concluded the concert<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
they laid aside their instruments, and during the
next ten minutes every man of them threw rings at
the canes or knives so rapidly that both Teddy and
his assistant had all they could do to wait upon the
throng.</p>

<p>Then, giving the signal for the march to be resumed,
the leader said to the young fakir:</p>

<p>"Don't get discouraged, my boy, no matter what
happens. If you have any trouble it can't last long,
for you've plenty of friends at the Run, and after
what happened here yesterday there should be a
good many on the grounds."</p>

<p>The kind-hearted musicians marched away without
giving Teddy an opportunity to thank them,
and as if to atone for their previously spoken harsh
words the bystanders devoted themselves with
unusual zest to the task of winning a cane worth a
dollar by an outlay of five cents.</p>

<p>It was nearly an hour before trade began to grow
dull again, and both the boys were quite willing to
rest a few moments.</p>

<p>"At this rate we stand a chance of getting rich
before the fair closes," Teddy exclaimed, in a tone
of satisfaction. "I wonder what Uncle Nathan
would have said if he'd been here to hear the
leader?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," a disagreeable but familiar sounding
voice replied from the rear of the stand where
its owner had been concealed by an adjoining booth,<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
and Nathan Hargreaves stalked into view with a
comically tragic air. "Things have come to a pretty
pass when a man's own relations, an' them as he
has set up in business with his own hard-earned
money, try to bring scorn and reproach upon him.
You are a snake in the grass, Teddy Hargreaves,
an' not content with helpin' rob me, concoct such a
disgraceful scene as I have jest witnessed."</p>

<p>"What could I have had to do with it?" Teddy
cried, in surprise. "I didn't know they were going
to give me a lift."</p>

<p>"Of course you did; I ain't blind if I am such a
fool as to put you in the way of makin' so much
money. There wasn't a man in that band who'd
have countenanced the speech the leader made if
you hadn't been workin' on their sympathies. But
your race won't be much longer. Don't think that
I've stopped all proceedings, for it may be that
you're shoved into jail this very day unless you
make a clean breast of the whole thing."</p>

<p>"I've got nothing to tell simply because I don't
know anything; but I believe the same man who
took my fifteen dollars robbed your store. Dan and
I heard him and another fellow talking, and in trying
to find out something for your benefit got
knocked down."</p>

<p>"What did they say? Who are they?" the old
man asked, eagerly, his bearing toward Teddy
changing very suddenly. "Tell me! Tell your poor,<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
old uncle, who'll be mighty near the poor-house, if
he don't get his own again."</p>

<p>This appeal touched Teddy's heart immediately,
but Tim said, half to himself, taking good care Uncle
Nathan should hear him, however:</p>

<p>"More'n a hundred robberies like that wouldn't
make him poor. Why, down at the Run folks say
you'd hardly miss what's been taken."</p>

<p>"Those who make that kind of talk are only shiftless
people with never a dollar of their own, consequently
they don't know the value of one," the old
man cried, angrily. "It's all very well for a set of
loafers who are mad with me because I wouldn't
give them credit to say such things. Do you suppose
I'd spend my time runnin' around the country
huntin' for the thieves if I hadn't lost a power of
money?"</p>

<p>"You'd be willin' to run pretty far if there was a
nickel at the end of the road," Tim retorted, but before
he could say anything more Teddy motioned
for him to be silent.</p>

<p>"Are you goin' to tell me who the robbers are?"
Uncle Nathan asked, in a wheedling tone, as he
turned once more toward his nephew.</p>

<p>"I don't know the men whom I suspect, except
by sight, but it's more than possible we may find
out enough to warrant their arrest before the fair
closes."</p>

<p>The old man insisted on knowing at once, and alternately<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
coaxed and threatened, but all to no purpose.</p>

<p>Teddy positively refused to make a statement until
he had more proof, and recognizing the fact that
he might hurt his own cause by insisting, Uncle
Nathan said, in a most affectionate tone:</p>

<p>"I must go now, Teddy, but I'll see you again before
night. If you'll do all you can to help find
them scoundrels I'll never say that you had anything
to do with the crime."</p>

<p>"You'd no business to make any such talk,
for you knew it was impossible for me to take any
hand in it, even if I'd wanted to be a thief."</p>

<p>"There's a good deal of circumstantial evidence,"
the old man said, solemnly, as he turned to leave,
"an' it stands you in hand to do all a boy can to
clear your own skirts. I'm goin' to give you a
chance, an' promise there won't be any arrest made
to-day at all events."</p>

<p>"There's a good reason why you promise that,"
Tim cried, angrily, as Uncle Nathan walked away.
"You tried mighty hard, but couldn't get a warrant,
an' there ain't a justice of the peace between
here an' Waterville as would grant one without any
other evidence than what you can say."</p>

<p>"Don't make him angry, Tim. He's feeling bad
about his money, an' you can't blame him for trying
to find out who has got it."</p>

<p>"I don't blame him for that, but what I'm kickin'<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
about is that he keeps naggin' at you when there's
no reason for it."</p>

<p>"Most likely he thinks there is."</p>

<p>"He can't; it's only the wretched old skinflint's
way of gettin' even with the world, an' so he picks
on a feller what he believes can't strike back."</p>

<p>"I wish I could find out who the robbers are, and
where the goods have been hidden."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't. It serves him right to lose 'em,
an'&mdash;&mdash; Hello! here comes that feller what helps
exhibit the rifles! I wonder what he wants at this
time of day, jest when business is beginnin' to be
rushin'."</p>

<p>Dan was evidently in a high state of excitement,
for he forced his way through the crowds, regardless
of possible injury to himself or others, and did
not slacken speed until he stood in front of the
cane-board, breathless and panting.</p>

<p>"What's up?" Teddy asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>"The fakir who got your money, an' another
man, who I think is the same one we heard talkin'
outside the tent, have jest bought a boat from the
Davis Company. Sam saw 'em, an' ran over to tell
me while the bargain was bein' made. He's
watchin' down there till we can get back."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it would do any good for me to
say another word to Long Jim. He went past here
this mornin', an' I only made a bad matter worse
by trying to make him give back what he stole."<span class="pagenum">[115]</span></p>

<p>"We ain't countin' on doin' that, but I believe
they're gettin' ready to cart away the goods what
were stole from your Uncle Nathan. Perhaps we
can foller without bein' seen, an' get on to the whole
snap. Could you get off for the balance of the day?"</p>

<p>And now Teddy was quite as excited as Dan.</p>

<p>"Yes, an' so can Sam."</p>

<p>"Are you goin' to help find his goods after all that
old duffer has threatened?" Tim asked, impatiently.</p>

<p>"I'll do what I can," was the decided reply. "Do
you think you will be able to get along alone to-day?"</p>

<p>"I could do it easy enough by hirin' a boy to pick
up the rings, but I hate to see you make a fool of
yourself, Teddy."</p>

<p>"You'll think different later. Come on, Dan. I'll
be back as soon as I can, Tim," and then the young
fakir urged his friend in the direction of the creek.</p>

<p>"It won't do to go anywhere near the boat-house,"
Dan said. "Sam is up the bank a long piece
where the willows hide him. He's keepin' his eye
on the craft they bought, so it can't be taken away
without his seein' it."</p>

<p>By mingling with the crowd it was possible to
make their way to the desired spot without being
seen, save by those with whom they came into immediate
contact, and in a few moments the watcher
was joined by his friends.</p>

<p>"Now I want you fellers to let me manage this<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
case," Sam said, pompously. "I know more 'bout
detective business than both of you put together,
an' if you'd only told me what was up the other
night we'd had the whole thing settled."</p>

<p>"Have you seen the men?" Dan asked, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Lots of times. The old fakir is loafin' around
close by the landin', an' the other one must 'a gone
off for somethin'. The Davis Company told me I
could take any of the boats, an' the minute the
thieves start we'll jump right on their trail."</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>AMATEUR DETECTIVES.</i></p>

<p>It was fated that the thrilling work of running
down and capturing the thieves should not be
begun until after considerable delay.</p>

<p>"Now, I wonder what he is up to?" Dan said,
when it was no longer possible to see the supposed
burglar.</p>

<p>"Why is it that you can't let me do this thing?"
Sam asked, angrily. "If you keep meddlin' we'll
never fix matters."</p>

<p>"I don't see that I'm interfering," Dan replied, in
surprise.</p>

<p>The three boys watched this one particular boat
in silence for ten minutes or more, seeing Long
Jim now and then, and just as they believed he
was about to step on board the man walked toward
the exhibition buildings, and was soon lost to view
amid the throng of people.</p>

<p>"You was gettin' ready, too, I could tell that by
your eye."</p>

<p>"I'll have to give in that you're the smartest
feller in this section of the country, Sam, an' that's
a fact."<span class="pagenum">[118]</span></p>

<p>"Of course it is," the amateur detective replied,
complacently, thinking Dan's sarcasm was really
praise. "If I have my own way I can turn up the
biggest thief that ever walked on two legs; but you
mustn't bother me, or things may go wrong."</p>

<p>If the matter had not been so serious to him
Teddy would have laughed long and often at the
dignity and superior knowledge assumed by this
fellow, who, since he made his acquaintance, had
done nothing more difficult than to get himself into
trouble; but, under the circumstances, he was so
deeply interested in the outcome of the business
that there was no room in his mind for mirth.</p>

<p>"Dan," he said, "let you and I walk around two
or three minutes. We'll stay close by so that Sam
can give us the signal in case the men show up, and
we may find Hazelton."</p>

<p>"Don't tell him what we're doin'," the amateur
detective cried, sharply.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"'Cause it's likely he'll want to meddle with our
business, an' then my work will be spoiled."</p>

<p>"I won't say a word to him until after seeing you
again," Teddy replied as he led Dan away, and
added when they were where it would be impossible
for Sam to hear them: "See here, it's foolish for
us to think of trying to follow those men if he's to
be allowed to make a fool of himself. With him
believing he's the greatest detective in the country,<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
something wrong is sure to happen, an' we may
never get another chance of finding out about the
burglary."</p>

<p>"Don't fret about that," Dan replied, confidently.
"It won't do any harm to let him swell a little now
while he's keeping watch; but when the real work
begins it won't take long to sit on him."</p>

<p>"Then there will be a row."</p>

<p>"I'll attend to his case; but I don't think there'll
be anything for us to do yet awhile. The men are
evidently in no hurry to leave, and most likely
intend to wait till the crowd begins to go."</p>

<p>"Then why should all three of us stay on watch?"</p>

<p>"We won't. Go back to your cane-board, and I'll
tell Sam to come for you when the burglars put in
an appearance. He'll have time to do that, an'
while he's gettin' a boat ready you can come for
me."</p>

<p>"Will it be safe to trust him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," Dan replied, with a laugh. "He's
havin' an awful good time thinkin' he's the greatest
detective in the world, and couldn't be hired to
leave that clump of willows so long as the men
keep out of sight."</p>

<p>Teddy was not so confident, and insisted on going
back with Dan while the arrangement was made.</p>

<p>When the matter was explained Sam appeared to
be perfectly satisfied.</p>

<p>"That's all right," he said, readily. "I can see<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
to this thing alone; but I'll let you fellers know
the minute anything happens. Don't tell any of
the constables what I'm up to, or they'll want to
have a finger in the pie."</p>

<p>Convinced that he would be informed of any
change in the situation, Teddy returned to the
cane-board just in time to aid Tim in attending to
a rush of customers who were spending their money
liberally.</p>

<p>"What made you come back?" the clerk asked,
in surprise. "I've hired a feller for a quarter to
pick up rings, an' am gettin' along first rate."</p>

<p>Teddy briefly explained the condition of affairs,
and then there was little opportunity for conversation
until considerably past noon, when trade
dropped off very decidedly for a while.</p>

<p>In order that he might have a glimpse of the
other fakirs and rest himself at the same time,
Tim was sent to see if Sam was yet at his self-selected
post of duty, and Teddy took advantage of
the opportunity to ascertain the amount of his
receipts.</p>

<p>To his great surprise he found nearly forty dollars
in the money-box, and from this he took thirty
with which to pay the merchant in Waterville who
had given him credit for his stock.</p>

<p>"It has turned out to be a mighty good venture,
even if Aunt Sarah was so sure I'd make a fool of
myself by tryin' it. All the money I make now will
<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>be clear profit, and it looks as if I'd be able to help
mother quite a bit."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus125.jpg" width="600" height="506" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">&quot;They&#39;re getting ready to start!&quot; he said, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Well, how is business?" a voice asked, in a
cheery tone, and, looking up, Teddy saw his sole
remaining creditor.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've come," he cried, bundling the
thirty dollars up in a piece of paper. "I'd jest
counted this out for you, an' when you take it I'll
be free from debt."</p>

<p>"But I don't want the money," the merchant
replied. "I only came around to see if you were
successful."</p>

<p>"I've already made more than I reckoned on, an'
it'll be a favor if you take this, 'cause I don't like
to have so much around."</p>

<p>Then Teddy explained the condition of his business
affairs, not forgetting to tell of the accusation
made against him by his Uncle Nathan, and the
merchant said, as he concluded:</p>

<p>"I heard the whole story, my boy, and have
already talked with Mr. Hargreaves, whom I met a
few moments ago. I do not think he can do anything
to you, because you have made many friends
here. The money I will take, as it is not well to
keep it where it might be stolen; but can give you
no receipt until I get home."</p>

<p>"That'll be all right," Teddy replied, contentedly;
"you trusted me with the goods, an' it would be
funny if I couldn't wait for a receipted bill. It's<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
through you that I've had the chance to make so
much, an' I want you to know I feel grateful."</p>

<p>"I believe that, and am more than pleased to
have put you in the way of getting a start in the
world. Come to see me when the fair closes, and it
is possible I may show you an opportunity of learning
to be a merchant on a large scale, rather than
a fakir whose method of getting a living is very
precarious, regardless of the fact that he sometimes
makes very great profits."</p>

<p>It can be readily understood that Teddy accepted
the invitation, and then, trade commencing once
more, the gentleman walked away, leaving the
proprietor of the cane-board with the pleasing consciousness
that he was free from debt, and with
quite a large amount of money in his mother's
keeping.</p>

<p>Tim returned very shortly after the merchant's
departure, and reported that Sam was still on
duty.</p>

<p>"The boat hasn't been moved nor have the men
showed up again," he said. "That feller acts as if
he thought he was bigger than the President. He
told me he could be the greatest detective that ever
lived if it wasn't that folks made him show off at
rowin' 'cause he had so much style about him. I
don't think he's so very wonderful; but, of course,
I never saw many out an' out detectives."</p>

<p>"And you don't see one when you met him. I'm<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
sure he'll get Dan an' me in trouble before this
thing is ended."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you let him go off alone? That's
what I'd do with such a chump."</p>

<p>"I can't, because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sentence was not concluded, for at that
moment Dan came up at full speed.</p>

<p>"They're gettin' ready to start!" he said, breathlessly.
"I saw 'em go by the buildin', an' run over
to tell Sam that I'd fetch you. Our boat is a long
distance up the creek, an' we'll have to hurry, or
run the chance of missing their craft."</p>

<p>There was no delay on Teddy's part, despite the
misgivings he had regarding Sam.</p>

<p>One parting injunction to Tim on the subject of
business, and then he followed Dan at full speed
toward the creek on such a course as would bring
them fully a quarter of a mile above the boat-house
outside the fair grounds.</p>

<p>Sam had made everything ready for the journey
by the time they arrived, and was so excited that
he could no longer speak of his own wonderful
powers as a thief-catcher.</p>

<p>"One of you fellers had better row while I steer,"
he said, seating himself in the stern sheets and
taking the tiller-ropes. "If they see the way I
handle the oars they'll know exactly who's after
them, an' then the game'll be up."</p>

<p>"Don't worry yourself about that," Dan replied,<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
calmly. "Neither Teddy nor I knows anything
about a boat, except it may be to steer, so you'll
have to hump yourself."</p>

<p>Sam grumbled considerably about taking so
many risks; but he finally moved over to the bow
and his companions took their seats aft.</p>

<p>"I won't put any style to it, an', perhaps, that'll
keep 'em from knowin' I'm on their trail," he said,
and immediately began rowing in such a bungling
fashion that Dan said, sharply:</p>

<p>"Look here, if you're goin' to pull this boat, do
it, or we'll go back. At this rate, you'll have everybody
at the fair watching to see what kind of
chumps have been allowed to risk their lives.
We've got no time to spare, either; for we must
get on the other side of the creek where it will be
possible to watch the men without getting too
near."</p>

<p>"I'll take care of that part of the business," Sam
replied, loftily, and Dan immediately put into operation
his plan of "sitting" on the amateur detective.</p>

<p>"You do your share, and that will be enough.
Teddy and I propose to take a hand in this ourselves."</p>

<p>"Then I might as well go back."</p>

<p>"You can, if you want to."</p>

<p>It so chanced that he had no such desire, and
with the air of one whose feelings have been deeply
wounded he rowed steadily on, Dan steering, until
<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>they were where it was possible to have a full view
of a long stretch of the creek.</p>

<p class="caption">THE BOYS WATCHING THE SUPPOSED BURGLARS<br />&quot;There they are!&quot; Teddy said.</p>

<p>"There they are!" Teddy said, pointing down
stream to where a boat was being pulled close to
the left bank. "They have stopped, and it looks as
if something was being taken on board!"</p>

<p>"It is a portion of the goods they stole!" Dan
cried. "Stop rowing, Sam, and if nothing happens
we'll soon know where the whole lot is to be hidden."</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>THE RENDEZVOUS.</i></p>

<p>That Dan's surmise was correct could be seen a
few moments after, while the boys, partially concealed
by the overhanging bank, watched the proceedings
with but little danger of being discovered.</p>

<p>On the shore were a number of packages in a
cart, and these the supposed burglars loaded into
the boat with the utmost haste.</p>

<p>If this lot comprised all that had been taken from
Uncle Nathan his loss must have been greater than
he stated, and Teddy said, after watching several
moments in silence:</p>

<p>"I reckon this is only part of what they took; but
I'm puzzled to know how it could have been
brought so far. The idea of carting goods over here
to find a place in which to hide them is a queer one,
when all the thieves had to do was slip down the
river in a skiff, an' before morning they'd be
beyond reach of the officers."</p>

<p>It surely was strange that the men should have
done so much useless labor, and the only solution
to the apparent mystery was offered by Sam, who
said, with an air of superior wisdom:<span class="pagenum">[127]</span></p>

<p>"They've done it to throw me off the scent. That
fakir we saw in Waterville must have known who
I was."</p>

<p>"How does it happen he had the nerve to come
here when he knew you counted on showing the
people who visited this fair your skill in rowing?"
Dan asked, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"I reckon he didn't think I was tellin' the truth."</p>

<p>It was useless to attempt to make Sam acquainted
with himself. He had such a remarkable idea of
his own abilities, despite the scrapes he was constantly
getting into, that the most eloquent orator
would have been unable to convince him he was
anything more than a very egotistical boy, with
little save his vanity to recommend him to the
notice of the general public.</p>

<p>In five minutes the boat at the opposite bank had
received as much of a cargo as her owners wished
to carry, and then the men began to row leisurely
down the river.</p>

<p>"Now, go slow, Sam, and don't turn around to
look, or they may suspect we are following them,"
Dan said, warningly. "I'll keep you posted about
what they are doing, and you can tell us afterward
what ought to have been done. Pull moderately,
for we don't want to get very near while it is light
enough for them to see us."</p>

<p>The chase was not a long one. By keeping the
boat's head to the bank and moving leisurely as<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
boys who were bent only on pleasure might have
done, the pursuers evidently caused no suspicions
as to their purpose, and after about a mile had been
traversed the burglars turned up a narrow waterway
which led to a barn or shed built on the meadows
for the storing of marsh hay.</p>

<p>There were plenty of ditches near at hand into
which the amateur detectives could run their craft
unobserved, and as the pursued left the creek Dan
steered into one of these.</p>

<p>Here their heads hardly came above the bank,
and all three could see the men carrying their cargo
to the building.</p>

<p>"We've got 'em now," said Sam, triumphantly,
as the first of the packages was taken on shore,
"an' the sooner we nab both the better."</p>

<p>"How do you intend to set about such a job?"
Teddy asked.</p>

<p>"Go right up an' tell 'em we've been on their
track."</p>

<p>"And in less than two minutes you would get a
worse pounding than the toughs gave you last
night."</p>

<p>Sam appeared to realize the truth of this statement,
for he had no further suggestions to offer,
and Dan said, after some reflection:</p>

<p>"I think the best thing we can do will be to go
back to the fair. If those fellows find us here the
jig will be up; but it isn't likely they've got the<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
whole of their plunder with them, and intend to
come here again. We'll talk with some one and
find out a good plan, or keep our eyes peeled to
learn what they mean to do with the goods. If
they propose simply to hide them until there is a
chance to get the lot away safely, we shall have
the key to the situation an' can take plenty of time
deciding what should be done."</p>

<p>Sam did not again propose to make any attempt
at intimidating the men, and Teddy thought Dan's
scheme a wise one.</p>

<p>"They'll come here more than once before the
week is ended; you know they spoke of moving the
stuff when the exhibitors got ready to leave, an'
we'd better go back to the grounds before those
fellows have finished their work."</p>

<p>Sam pulled out of the water-course into the creek
without a murmur; but when they were on the
way back, and he felt at liberty to display his true
"style," courage returned.</p>

<p>"I knew you fellers wasn't any good on detective
work," he said, scornfully. "If I'd had charge of
the case we should have them men tied hand an'
foot in the bottom of this boat."</p>

<p>"How would you have got 'em there?" Dan
asked.</p>

<p>"That's my business. Jest because I've let you
into this thing there's no reason why I should give
all my secrets away, is there?"<span class="pagenum">[130]</span></p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, an' you keep them locked up in
your heart, for if Teddy an' I knew the plans we
might get into a bad scrape."</p>

<p>"Well, what are you goin' to do now?"</p>

<p>"Nothing until after we have talked with those
who know more than we do about such things."</p>

<p>Sam immediately relapsed into silence. His superior
knowledge had been scorned, and he proposed
to let his companions understand that he was not
pleased with them.</p>

<p>By the time the boys reached the bend in the
creek they could see the boat in which were Long
Jim and his companion, half a mile behind, and
Dan said:</p>

<p>"Those fellows don't know me. When we land
you and Sam had better keep out of sight, while I
try to find out where they go after striking the fair
ground."</p>

<p>"All right. It's time I helped Tim, an' you'll
come to the cane-board if there is anything to tell."</p>

<p>"So I don't amount to anything, eh?" Sam asked,
sulkily.</p>

<p>"Of course you do; but it would be foolish to
make a show of yourself to Long Jim, who would
remember you. Keep rowing around in the boat as
if you were at work, and there'll be no chance for
suspicion."</p>

<p>By this time the little craft was at the landing
stage of the boat-house, and two of the party leaped<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
out, leaving the third feeling that he had been unjustly
deprived of a very large portion of his rights.</p>

<p>"If them fellers think they're goin' to get the
best of me they're makin' a big mistake, an' I'll
show 'em so before night. They don't know any
more about bein' detectives than a cat; but both
will be mightily surprised before mornin', or I'm
mistaken."</p>

<p>Then, instead of rowing around the creek as
Dan had suggested, Sam pulled out into the middle
of the stream, looking wondrous wise and determined
as he awaited the coming of those whose
secret he had partially discovered.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Teddy and Dan, without the slightest
suspicion of what their friend proposed to do, separated
at the landing stage, the former making all
haste to reach his cane-board, where he found Tim
doing a thriving business, and standing near by
was Hazelton.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" the jewelry fakir
asked, solicitously. "I've come here two or three
times without finding you, and had almost begun
to believe old Nathan succeeded in getting a warrant."</p>

<p>Teddy was undecided as to whether he should tell
this acquaintance of all he had seen or not; but,
after some deliberation, and in view of the fact
that he also had been accused of the burglary, concluded
to do so.<span class="pagenum">[132]</span></p>

<p>"We've found out where Long Jim is hiding the
stuff he stole from my uncle," he said, and then
explained what had been done during the last
hour.</p>

<p>Hazelton was surprised that so much information
had been gained; but he was able to cause Teddy
an equal amount of astonishment.</p>

<p>"I don't believe the packages you saw came from
the old man's store. I heard, about two hours ago,
that a store here in town was robbed last night,
and it isn't dead sure, after your uncle's accusations,
and what I have done on the fair grounds,
that I sha'n't be arrested on suspicion. Most likely
the goods taken down the creek were stolen here;
but I don't understand why those fellows should
work so boldly."</p>

<p>"Probably they think, as one of them said the
other night, while so many articles are being carried
to and fro."</p>

<p>"Very likely that may be true, and now comes
the question of what shall be done regarding the
information you have gained. I stand in a mighty
delicate position, and, quite naturally, want to save
myself, if possible, for even an arrest when there is
little or no proof, ain't to be contemplated calmly."</p>

<p>"You ought to know better than I how we should
go to work. Dan an' I thought there would be
plenty of time, for if those fellows were going to
skip very soon they wouldn't have taken the trouble<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
to carry the stuff down there, where it could
not be gotten away quickly."</p>

<p>"I'll think the matter over, Teddy, and come
back here in a couple of hours," Hazelton said,
after a moment's thought.</p>

<p>"Don't tell anyone what you found out until
after seeing me again."</p>

<p>This conversation had been carried on at the rear
of the cane-board, where the customers could not
overhear it, and when the jewelry fakir walked
toward the exhibition building it was necessary to
satisfy Tim's curiosity regarding what had been
accomplished.</p>

<p>"I don't s'pose it's any of my business," the
latter said, when Teddy concluded the story; "but
I wouldn't be afraid to bet all I shall earn this week
that you'll have trouble with that feller before the
scrape is over. He knows so awful much that somethin'
tough is bound to happen."</p>

<p>Teddy did not think there was any good cause for
alarm, more especially since he felt confident Dan
would keep an eye on the oarsman, and during the
next two hours he thought of nothing save earning
money, for customers were plenty, and even with
the assistance of the boy Tim had engaged it was
all he and his clerk could do to wait upon those
who were anxious to win a cane or knife.</p>

<p>Now and then some of the other fakirs would
visit him; but, as a rule, all were so busy that there<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
was little time for the exchange of compliments,
and even the cry of "Three rings for five cents,
with the chance to get a dollar cane or knife for
nothing!" was not needed to stimulate trade.</p>

<p>It was two hours from the time of his return when
Dan came up looking decidedly uneasy, and Teddy
did not stop to make change for the man who had
just patronized him, before he asked, hurriedly:</p>

<p>"Now, what's up?"</p>

<p>"Sam is missing."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? How can that be?"</p>

<p>"He was to row around the creek near the landing;
but for the last hour no one has seen him, and,
what is more, the boat can't be found. Long Jim
an' his friend haven't come ashore, as near as I
can make out, an' it looks to me as if that foolish
Sam has got into trouble through trying to play
detective."</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>SAM'S ADVENTURES.</i></p>

<p>In order to explain Sam's absence, and one or two
other incidents in their regular sequence, it is necessary
to go back to the moment when, his friends
having landed, the amateur detective was left to his
own devices.</p>

<p>His first impulse was to report his arrival to the
manager of the boat exhibit, and then go about his
routine duties, but before this very proper plan
could be carried into effect he chanced to see Hazelton
on the shore.</p>

<p>"Now, what's he layin' around there for?" Sam
asked of himself. "I'll bet Dan or Teddy has given
the whole snap away, an' he's come to pull in the
burglars. It's a mighty mean trick for them to play
after I've worked the case so far that there's nothing
to do but nab 'em. He'll get all the praise, an'
folks won't know the job was managed by me."</p>

<p>The longer Sam thought of this apparent ingratitude
and treachery on the part of Teddy and
Dan the more angry he grew, and it did not require
many moments' thought for him to succeed in convincing<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
himself that he had been very shabbily
treated.</p>

<p>Continuing to talk to himself, or rather at the tiller,
on which his eyes were fixed, he added:</p>

<p>"Folks have said so much about their savin' them
women from drownin', when I mighter done the
same thing if I'd been willin' to make a fool of myself,
that they want to scoop in everything; but I
could stop this little game by jest goin' ahead on
my own hook. If I sneaked down the creek an'
brought back the stuff them men have been hidin'
people would begin to know how much I understand
about detective work."</p>

<p>This appeared in his mind as the most brilliant
scheme he had ever conceived, and in a very few
seconds Sam decided that it should be carried into
effect.</p>

<p>First, and with no very well-defined idea of why
such a course was necessary, he rowed cautiously
to and fro past the landing stage, scrutinizing
closely every face he saw, and mentally hugging
himself because of the excitement which would be
caused by his return with the stolen property.</p>

<p>Then he turned the boat, and began to row down
the creek, stopping every few seconds to gaze
around in such a mysterious manner that the suspicions
of any one who observed him would have
been instantly aroused.</p>

<p>In this manner, which he believed the only true<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
way for a first-class detective to approach his prey,
Sam had rowed less than half a mile when he saw
Long Jim and his companion returning.</p>

<p>Now the time had come when true cunning was
necessary, and the amateur detective began to display
it by pulling the boat sharply around, heading
her for an indentation on the opposite shore.</p>

<p>Here he ran her bow aground, and lying at full
length in the bottom, peered out at the men in the
most stealthy manner.</p>

<p>They had already taken notice of his erratic
movements, and now regarded him intently, but,
without checking the headway of their own craft,
in a few minutes were beyond sight around the
bend.</p>

<p>"There," Sam said, with a long-drawn breath of
relief, as he arose to a sitting posture, "if Teddy an'
Dan had been here them fellers would have tumbled
to the whole racket, but I've put 'em off the scent,
an' will have plenty of time to do my work."</p>

<p>He pulled out from the shore once more, gazed
long and earnestly up and down the creek, and
then, in the same ridiculous manner as before, continued
the journey.</p>

<p>The trip which should have consumed no more
than an hour even with the most indolent oarsman,
was not completed until twice that time had elapsed,
and then fully fifteen minutes were spent by this
very cautious boy in landing.<span class="pagenum">[138]</span></p>

<p>He pulled his boat up high out of the water, and,
in order to conceal her, heaped such a pile of dry
grass on top of her that it must have attracted the
attention of any one passing, more especially those
who were familiar with the creek.</p>

<p>This done he went toward the barn after the fashion
of an old-time stage villain, halting at the slightest
sound, and peering in every direction, fancying
himself surrounded by foes.</p>

<p>Not until he had circled completely around the
barn twice did he venture to enter, and then, much
to his disappointment, there was nothing to be
seen. The building appeared to be absolutely
empty, and even his eagle eye failed to discover
any traces of recent occupancy.</p>

<p>"Well, this is mighty funny," he said, with a sigh
of disappointment. "Them fellers surely brought a
lot of stuff in here, but they must have carried it
out again."</p>

<p>Having expended so much labor and time in
reaching this place, he did not intend to return until
after making a thorough search, however, and to
this end he investigated one possible hiding-place
after another, pulling up the boards of the rude
flooring, and peering into places where nothing
larger than a mouse could have been hidden.</p>

<p>During this time the burglars were returning
with all possible speed. Sam's actions, both as he
came down the creek, and also while screening<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
himself from view, were so suspicious that, guilty
as the men were, they immediately concluded what
was very near the truth.</p>

<p>Long Jim recognized the boy as having been with
Teddy when the bargain for the imaginary cane-board
was made, and instead of returning to the
fair grounds the two watched, from a point of
vantage on the bank, until Master Sam had landed.</p>

<p>His purpose was now evident, and it was necessary
the burglars should resort to desperate measures
to prevent the loss of their ill-gotten gains as
well as to save themselves from imprisonment.</p>

<p>When they arrived where it was possible to look
into the barn, Sam was on his knees scraping away
the dirt which appeared to have been recently disturbed,
and they heard him say in a tone of exultation:</p>

<p>"I've got to it at last, an' now we'll see what
Teddy an' Dan have to say when I flash the
whole lot of stuff up with nobody to help me. I
reckon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence, for at that moment
Long Jim stepped directly in front of him, as he
asked:</p>

<p>"Did you leave anything here, my son?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;that is&mdash;you see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sam was so frightened that he could not say another
word. It seemed as if his tongue was swollen
to twice its natural size, while his throat was<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
parched and dry, and to make bad matters worse,
he had entirely neglected to invent a plausible excuse
for his presence there in case of an interruption.</p>

<p>"I asked if you'd left anything here?" Long Jim
repeated, very mildly.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash; You see I jest come down to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash; I
thought, perhaps, I might find something,
but it's time I was gettin' back to the fair, 'cause
the folks will be needin' me."</p>

<p>As he spoke he attempted to back toward the
door, but before taking half a dozen steps a cry of
fear burst from his lips, for a heavy hand was laid
with no gentle force on his shirt collar, and he
staggered forward helplessly.</p>

<p>"That's an invitation for you to hold on a bit,
an' have a little conversation with two gentlemen
who are mighty curious to know why you came
here," Long Jim said, grimly. "You're goin' to
tell us the whole partic'lars, or there won't be
enough left of you to be seen under a microscope."</p>

<p>Sam made no reply. He was literally dazed with
fear, and just at that moment he thought the life
of a detective very disagreeable.</p>

<p>"Come, speak up, an' be quick about it," the man
cried, fiercely. "We've got no time to waste on
sich cubs as you, an' in about two minutes you'll
get worse'n we served out the other night."</p>

<p>"That wasn't me follerin' you from the museum<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
tent," Sam said, quickly, thinking possibly this fact
might work in his favor.</p>

<p>"Who was it?"</p>

<p>"Teddy an' Dan."</p>

<p>"Who is Dan?"</p>

<p>"A feller who works for the Stevens Arms Company
up at the fair."</p>

<p>"Why did they follow us?"</p>

<p>"Teddy wanted to get back the money he gave
you to buy a cane-board with."</p>

<p>"If he knows what's wise for him he'll stop any
such rackets, or he may get more'n he bargains
for."</p>

<p>Then the second man, who still held firmly to
Sam's collar, asked, as he shook his prisoner vigorously:</p>

<p>"How did you know we had been here?"</p>

<p>"Us fellers saw you come down in a boat."</p>

<p>"So all three are in the secret, eh?"</p>

<p>Sam's only thought was that he might possibly
save his own skin, and he replied in the affirmative,
although he must have known that by such answer
he was destroying his friends' chances of recovering
the goods.</p>

<p>"Where are the fools now?" Long Jim asked,
angrily.</p>

<p>"Up at the fair."</p>

<p>"What do they intend to do?"</p>

<p>"Get somebody to arrest you."<span class="pagenum">[142]</span></p>

<p>"Then we've got to skip mighty lively, Phil,"
and Long Jim looked up at his companion.</p>

<p>"Yes; but if my advice had been follered we
wouldn't be in this scrape. You was the only one
the cubs knew, an' by keepin' out of sight we
mighter finished the work that's been laid out.
You're so pig-headed that a yoke of oxen couldn't
keep you in hidin'."</p>

<p>"There's no use fightin' about it now; for we've
got to get a move on us in short order. It won't do
to let this boy have a chance to give the alarm."</p>

<p>"Of course not. Lash him up somewhere so he
can't make a noise, an' his chums will come before
he starves to death."</p>

<p>"Don't do that!" Sam cried, in an agony of terror.
"I won't say a word about your catchin' me here,
an' I'll do anything you say."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're a nice plum to make promises, ain't
you. It didn't take much persuadin' to make you
go back on your friends, an' that's enough to show
whether you can be trusted. Get the rope out of
the boat, Phil, an' then we'll make ready for a long
jump."</p>

<p>Phil obeyed, grumbling as he went because his
partner had refused to take his advice, thus plunging
both of them into danger, and Long Jim turned
his attention to the prisoner once more.</p>

<p>"Before we leave this part of the country for
good I'm goin' to give you somethin' to remember<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
us by so's you won't go 'round stickin' your nose
into other people's business agin."</p>

<p>"What are you goin' to do?" Sam asked, his face
growing even paler than before.</p>

<p>"Give you the worst floggin' a boy ever had. I'd
do it now if there wasn't so much work to be got
through."</p>

<p>Sam had sufficient sense to know that all his
pleadings for mercy would be in vain, and he held
his peace until Phil returned with a long coil of
rope which had been used as a boat's painter.</p>

<p>One of the beams at the end of the barn served as
a post to which to lash the prisoner, and here the
amateur detective was made fast in such a skillful
manner that he could not so much as move his
arms.</p>

<p>"Shall we gag him now?" Phil asked, and Long
Jim replied:</p>

<p>"No, there's time enough.</p>

<p>"He can't make any one hear if he yells his best,
an' I've got a little business to settle before he's
trussed up for good."</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>MISSING.</i></p>

<p>When Dan informed Teddy that Sam was missing,
and suggested the possibility of the burglars
having gotten him in their power, both the
boys were decidedly alarmed; but the matter ceased
to appear as serious after it had been discussed in
all its bearings.</p>

<p>"Long Jim wouldn't have dared to spirit him
away when there are so many people around,"
Teddy said, after a long silence, during which he
was trying to imagine what Sam might have done.
"Besides, what would be the good of taking him if
we were left behind?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps they count on hauling us in, too."</p>

<p>"That isn't to be thought of for a moment. They
don't want to burden themselves with a lot of boys
when every effort must be made to get the stolen
property out of this section of the country before
they are discovered."</p>

<p>"I'll allow all that sounds reasonable, but where
is Sam?"</p>

<p>"Of course I don't know. Do you think he would<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
dare to go down the river again after we landed?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed; he's too much of a coward for that.
If there's been any funny business it was done
when the men got back."</p>

<p>"Then we have no need to worry, for there are
hundreds of people on the bank of the creek all the
time, an' Sam would know enough to yell if anybody
tried to steal him."</p>

<p>The idea that the amateur detective might be
stolen seemed so comical to Dan that he gave way
to mirth, and what had promised to be a most sorrowful
visit speedily became a merry one.</p>

<p>"He had permission to remain away from the
exhibition building during the rest of the day,"
Teddy finally said, "an' most likely he's goin' to
take advantage of it by roaming around the
grounds, exercising his detective faculties. He'll
turn up at the museum to-night all right, with a
big yarn to tell about his supposed adventures."</p>

<p>"I reckon you're right; but I did get a little rattled
when his boss asked me where he was. I'll
come back this way when it's time to go to supper."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. I'm mighty hungry now, an'
business has been so good that I can afford to treat
to sandwiches an' lemonade, if you'll go with me
over to the grand stand. I'll bring you back something,
Tim," he added, as he leaped over the railing.</p>

<p>Dan said he could remain away half an hour from<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
the rifle exhibit, and Teddy was now so easy in
mind concerning money matters that he resolved
to have thirty minutes of sport.</p>

<p>The boys first made a tour of that portion of the
grounds where the fakirs were congregated, stopping
a moment to see the whip dealer lashing a
pine stake to show the quality of his goods, and
then watching the "Great African Dodger," who
thrust his woolly head through an aperture in a
canvas screen for all those to throw balls at who
were inclined to pay the price.</p>

<p>Then they stopped at the "envelope game," where
were spread on a stand a large collection of cheap,
gaudy goods, each bearing a printed number, every
one supposed to correspond with those contained
in a box of envelopes, and this fakir was doing a
big business, as was shown by the fact that he
could afford to hire a barker, who cried continually
at the full strength of his lungs:</p>

<p>"Come up now, and try your luck! Here's where
we have all prizes and no blanks! Ten cents buys
an envelope, with the privilege of drawing for
yourself, so there can be no job put up against you,
and every number calls for some one of the many
valuable articles in the layout. Here's a gentleman
who spends only ten cents and gets a pair of
those beautiful, triple-plated, double-expansion,
fine pure metal cuff buttons, worth two dollars at
some stores!"<span class="pagenum">[147]</span></p>

<p>"Come on!" Dan said, impatiently. "That fellow
is almost as big a snide as Hazelton."</p>

<p>"How do you make that out? I can see a lot of
things that cost more than a dollar. Look at the
silver watch, and the revolver."</p>

<p>"That may be all very well; but no one except a
fellow who is interested in the business gets any of
those articles."</p>

<p>"You can select any envelope you choose."</p>

<p>"That's right; but the ones with the numbers
calling for the big prizes are lying flat in the box
where nobody can get them. If you should accuse
the man of cheating he would turn the whole thing
upside down, and then, of course, they could be
found. Here comes a fellow who I know is cappin'
for that fakir. Watch how he does it."</p>

<p>The apparent stranger approached the stand, and
after some talk as to how the game was run, invested
ten cents.</p>

<p>The man did not open the envelope he drew; but
handed it to the fakir, who, pretending to look at
the card it contained, shouted:</p>

<p>"Number fifty-four. The gentleman has drawn
that beautiful solid silver watch worth fifty dollars,
and I will give him thirty for his bargain."</p>

<p>The stranger showed his prize to the crowd that
clustered around him, and business was increased
wonderfully, for it had apparently been proven
that the game was conducted fairly.<span class="pagenum">[148]</span></p>

<p>"Now watch him," Dan said, as the stranger
walked away with his prize ostentatiously displayed,
and the two boys followed a short distance
off, until they saw him halt behind a booth, where
he turned the article won over to a barker who had
approached.</p>

<p>"That's the way it is done," Dan said, "and when
we come back you'll see the same watch on the layout."</p>

<p>Teddy was rapidly being initiated in the tricks of
the fakirs, and the more he saw the more firmly
was he resolved not to follow the business longer
than the present week, although he believed his
own game to be an honest one.</p>

<p>The cheap jewelry dealer; the man who had been
selling the remnants of a stock of knives made by a
manufacturer who "had bankrupted himself by
putting into them too expensive material;" the
fakir with the dolls which were to be knocked down
by balls thrown from a certain distance, with a
prize of one cigar if the customer could tumble two
over, and the peanut-candy dealer were visited in
turn, and then the boys were attracted by the sound
of Hazelton's voice.</p>

<p>He was plying his peculiar trade again, and by
the appearance of the crowd was meeting with
great success.</p>

<p>"Let's see how he gets out of it this time," Teddy
suggested, and Dan agreed.<span class="pagenum">[149]</span></p>

<p>The fakir had arrived at that point where he was
giving away the supposed watches, and the boys
listened until they saw his preparations for departure.</p>

<p>"What beats me is how he gets clear every time,"
Dan whispered. "I should think after he had
swindled four or five hundred, some of them would
lay for a chance to get even with him."</p>

<p>"He says they do, an' that's why he left his
satchel with me."</p>

<p>Hazelton recognized the boys just as he was telling
that Nathan Hargreaves might possibly act as
his agent after the close of the fair, and nodded
pleasantly, as he gathered up the reins; but this
was one of the occasions when he was not to be
allowed to go scot free.</p>

<p>Two stalwart-looking fellows were standing near
the head of the horse, and when the fakir would
have driven off they seized the bridle, one of them
shouting:</p>

<p>"Come down with that money! This is the second
time I've seen you do us countrymen up to-day, and
now you've got to square things."</p>

<p>Hazelton swung his whip around, striking the
speaker full in the face, and causing the horse to
plunge and rear, but yet the fellows kept their hold.</p>

<p>The whip was pulled from the fakir's hand, and
in an instant it appeared as if a riot had begun.
Those who had been content to keep secret the fact<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>
of having been swindled now grew bold as they
saw there was a leader in the movement, and more
than a hundred leaped forward to seize the representative
of the alleged jewelry manufacturers.</p>

<p>"He'll be killed!" Teddy shouted, and would have
attempted to go to the assistance of the man who
had been kind to him, despite the fact that he could
not have aided him in any way against so many;
but for the fact that Dan pulled him back, as he
shouted:</p>

<p>"Can't you see that it would be fifty to one if you
should go in that crowd? We couldn't help him,
and what's the use of gettin' a big lickin' for nothing?
Besides, what would become of your business
if the people here thought you were his partner?"</p>

<p>Before Dan ceased speaking Teddy realized how
useless would be any effort of his, and he remained
passive, trying to get a glimpse of the ill-fated
fakir.</p>

<p>The numbers who beset him completely hid Hazelton
from view. The carriage had been overturned
by the first desperate rush of the victims,
and the horse was clearing a space around himself
by the free use of his heels.</p>

<p>"They'll commit murder!" Teddy cried.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it'll be quite as bad as that; but
he won't be likely to give away any more lockets
while this fair lasts."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Hazelton was not left to
<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>fight the battle alone. Like every other fakir
engaged in that peculiar business, he had several
partners whose duty it was to mingle with the
crowd for the purpose of intimidating any who
might be disposed to make trouble, and these had
closed in upon him, while some of the more timid
spectators shouted for the constables.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p class="caption">&quot;Run as you never did before, Teddy, for if they get hold of us it&#39;ll be a bad job all around!&quot;</p>

<p>Once Teddy caught a glimpse of the unfortunate
man; his glossy hat was gone, his clothing torn,
and his face covered with blood.</p>

<p>"I can see him now!" he cried, "and it looks as
if they had about used him up, for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Before he could finish the sentence a stranger
rushed toward him, and showing the familiar black
satchel in his hand, said hurriedly:</p>

<p>"Get out of here with that. Hazelton will see
you some time this evening. Don't stop a minute!"</p>

<p>Before the boy could reply the stranger was forcing
his way through the struggling, yelling crowd,
in order to aid his partner, and Teddy said in dismay:</p>

<p>"Now we are in a muss. Here is all his money,
an' if anybody sees us with it we'll have a tough
time."</p>

<p>"You can't throw it away, an' we must sneak
off," Dan said, and the expression on his face told
how distressed he was that such a responsibility
had been thrust upon them.</p>

<p>"Shall we go back to the stand?"<span class="pagenum">[152]</span></p>

<p>"No, that would never do, for then they would be
sure to vent their anger on you. Go up to the
museum; Mr. Sweet knows Hazelton, an' may be
willin' to help him by keeping the satchel till the
row is over."</p>

<p>These words had been spoken as the boys were
trying to make their way through the fringe of
spectators which had hemmed them in since the
fight began, and after some difficulty they
succeeded; but at the same moment one of the
combatants, who had received more than his
share of punishment, emerged close by their
side.</p>

<p>He saw Hazelton's satchel, and recognized it.</p>

<p>"Come here, fellows! two little villains are making
off with the money! That's what we want!"</p>

<p>He at once started in pursuit, as did several
others, and Dan cried, as he helped carry the burden:</p>

<p>"Run as you never did before, Teddy, for if they
get hold of us it'll be a bad job all around!"</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>A TERRIBLE NIGHT.</i></p>

<p>At just about the same moment when Teddy and
Dan were running with Hazelton's money at
full speed toward the museum tent, with the chance
of escape very much against them, Sam was in a decidedly
painful frame of mind.</p>

<p>After he had been securely tied the two men
conversed in low tones for several minutes, and
then, as if having arrived at some definite conclusion,
began to make preparations for leaving the
place.</p>

<p>At the same spot where Sam had been interrupted
while scraping away the dirt they proceeded
to dig with a shovel which Phil procured
from somewhere outside the building, and during
this labor the prisoner could hear fragments of the
conversation.</p>

<p>Once Long Jim ceased his work long enough to
say:</p>

<p>"When you come to look at the matter quietly it
doesn't seem as if we'd got into sich a very bad
scrape. You can manage to bring the rest of the<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
stuff down the creek between now an' Friday
mornin' and I've got a plan for givin' anybody who
may come after us a good clue to the boy's disappearance."</p>

<p>Phil made some remark which Sam could not
hear, and his companion replied in a louder tone:</p>

<p>"It can all be done so's to make folks think we've
gone up the creek, an' we've got to lay low for a
while, which won't be a hard job while the weather
is warm."</p>

<p>"But I don't like the idea of totin' that cub with
us so long."</p>

<p>"I'll take care of him, an' will make him earn his
board, or somethin's bound to break."</p>

<p>From this time until several packages were unearthed
Sam could hear nothing; but what had
already been said was sufficient to convince him
that he was to have a very unpleasant experience,
and for at least the hundredth time he fervently
wished he had never so much as heard of detective
work.</p>

<p>After the goods had been brought to light the
earth was replaced in the excavation and pounded
down carefully. Then fully half an hour was spent
digging in different places, probably for the purpose
of misleading any one who might come there
in search of plunder, for Phil said in a tone of satisfaction
as he ceased the apparently aimless labor:</p>

<p>"It'll take at least a day before all of these suspicious<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
looking spots have been investigated, an'
in the meanwhile, unless we're chumps, we shall
know what's goin' on. I'll take one load to the
boat; make sure the coast is clear, an' then the
three of us can carry the balance. Have the boy
ready for a quick move, an' see to it that he can't
give an alarm."</p>

<p>"I'll knock his head off if he so much as thinks
of such a thing," and as Phil disappeared with a portion
of the plunder Long Jim began to unfasten
Sam's bonds, saying as he did so:</p>

<p>"We've made up our minds to hold you with us
a few days 'cause you're sich jolly company. If
you obey orders an' keep your mouth shut there's
a chance of gettin' outer this scrape mighty easy;
but I'd slit your throat in a jiffy if you tried to give
us the slip or made any noise."</p>

<p>Sam made no reply; but his captor could see
very plainly that the boy was nearly paralyzed
with fright, and it was safe to infer he would follow
the instructions given to the letter.</p>

<p>Phil returned in a very short time and reported:</p>

<p>"The coast is clear. There's not a craft to be seen
on the creek, an' we can leave without danger."</p>

<p>The rope had been removed from Sam's limbs,
and Long Jim proceeded to load him down with
bundles until he staggered under the weight.</p>

<p>"Now, see that you walk a chalk line," the burglar
said, fiercely. "Foller Phil, an' I'll keep behind<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
to make sure there are no tricks played. Remember
what I promised!"</p>

<p>The men could carry the remainder of the goods
in one load, and the three went out of the barn hurriedly,
Sam not daring to so much as lift his eyes
from the ground lest Long Jim's threat should be
carried into execution.</p>

<p>Arriving at the water's edge the boat was loaded,
the prisoner ordered to take his place at the oars,
and then the final preparations were made.</p>

<p>Phil uncovered the boat in which Sam had come,
launched and overturned her. Then taking the
hat from the unresisting boy's head, threw it far
out in the channel, afterward giving the little craft
a shove which sent her a long distance from the
shore. Next the two oars were sent after the hat,
and Phil said with a laugh:</p>

<p>"The current ain't very strong; but with the aid
of the wind I reckon that stuff will drift up to the
fair grounds before dark."</p>

<p>Sam's despair was already so great that it did not
seem as if it could be increased; but the last vestige
of hope fled when he realized that these things
had been done in order to make it appear as if he
were dead.</p>

<p>"Teddy and Dan won't think of huntin' for me
after the boat is found," he thought, "an' these
men are sure to kill me before this scrape is over!"</p>

<p>The two burglars seated themselves comfortably<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
in the stern-sheets, the packages being placed at
the bow to trim the craft properly, and Long Jim
said, sternly:</p>

<p>"You've been showin' off your skill as an oarsman
for two or three days, an' we want you to do
it now. Put in your best licks, for it'll be tough
if we don't get through the water mighty fast."</p>

<p>Even Sam's worst enemy would have pitied him
at this moment. No galley slave chained to his
seat could have been more utterly helpless, and
he exerted himself to the utmost in order to please
those who professed to be so willing to punish or
kill.</p>

<p>Every stroke of the oars took them farther away
from the fair grounds, and each puff of wind carried
the evidences of the prisoner's death nearer
the only ones who might take the trouble to search
for him.</p>

<p>Not until fully an hour had passed did the burglars
give any sign of a desire to end the journey,
and then Long Jim said:</p>

<p>"We must be six miles from the fair grounds by
this time, an' that is as far as you'll want to pull
to-night, Phil. There should be plenty of good
hidin'-places in this bit of woods, an' I think we'd
better haul up."</p>

<p>"All right. Steer her into that ditch over there,
an' we'll look around."</p>

<p>Thus far in his experience as a detective this was<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
the only thing Sam had had for which to be thankful.
His arms were so tired that it seemed as if he
could not have pulled another stroke, and his
clothes were literally wet from the perspiration
that came from his body.</p>

<p>Phil went ashore, leaving his companion to
watch the almost exhausted prisoner, and in a few
moments the former shouted:</p>

<p>"Load that cub up, an' bring him over here.
This is a capital place to locate in for a couple of
days."</p>

<p>Staggering under the heavy burden Long Jim
placed on his shoulders the amateur detective was
forced on through the underbrush in advance of
his captor until the two arrived at a perfect tangle
of cedars.</p>

<p>Phil returned to the boat for the remainder of the
goods, and all the plunder was placed inside the
thicket where the foliage was so dense that one
might have passed within a few feet of the spot
and not had any suspicion men were hidden there.</p>

<p>A tiny brook ran past one side of the hiding-place,
and Sam took advantage of the opportunity
to check his raging thirst while the men were laying
plans for the future.</p>

<p>"I'll go back soon after sunset," Phil said, as he
lighted his pipe and proceeded to make himself
comfortable. "We can leave the boy here to look
out for the stuff, an' you'd better come with me up<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
to the barn so's to learn if any one visits the place.
I shall be back before morning, an' you can let me
know if the coast is clear."</p>

<p>"Shall you try to finish the job we were talkin'
about?"</p>

<p>"No; things are so hot jest now that it won't pay
to take any more risks than are absolutely necessary.
What we want is to get out of this portion of
the country as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll leave you to manage the rest of
the business, an' promise to follow orders."</p>

<p>"I think it's about time you said that, Jim. If
my plans had been carried out in the first place we
wouldn't be in sich a muss; but could be havin'
the cream of the pickin's at the fair."</p>

<p>"Well, what's the use of harpin' on that all the
time? The thing has been done, an' we've got to
make the best of it. Do you think it'll be safe to
leave this cub here alone while we're away?"</p>

<p>"It will be when I get through with him," was
the grim reply, and Sam, terrified by the vagueness
of this remark, more even than he had been by the
plain language previously used, cried, piteously:</p>

<p>"Please don't leave me here alone to-night! I'll
pull the boat, an' do everything you say, without
so much as yippin'."</p>

<p>"Them as starts out in the detective business
have to take what comes, 'specially when their
own foolishness brings it about. You joined our<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
party of your own accord, my son, an' must put up
with what we choose to give."</p>

<p>Sam said nothing more. He was reaping what
he had sowed, and decided that matters could not
be much worse even if he was caught trying to
escape, therefore he resolved to take desperate
chances in an effort to give his captors the slip.</p>

<p>There was no opportunity to make the attempt,
on this night at least, for when Phil had finished
smoking he proceeded in a very methodical manner
to secure the prisoner.</p>

<p>Sam was ordered to seat himself on the ground,
with his back to the trunk of a cedar-tree, and he
was fastened skillfully, with his elbows tied back
in such a manner that he could not bring his hands
together. Both feet were bound, and then, with a
sudden movement, Phil forced the boy's mouth
open, shoving into it a short piece of pine wood
about an inch and a half in diameter.</p>

<p>This was secured in such a manner that the prisoner
could not free himself from the uncomfortable
bridle, neither would it be possible for him to make
the slightest outcry.</p>

<p>"Now, don't shout for help while we are gone,
an' unless the bears eat you up we shall meet
again about daybreak," Phil said, with a coarse
laugh as he and Jim went out of the thicket toward
the creek.</p>

<p>Poor Sam had never thought of the possibility<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
that there might be bears in this section of the
country until the burglar suggested it, and he was
so terrified as not to realize it was impossible there
could be any dangerous animals in such a thickly-settled
portion of the State.</p>

<p>Therefore, in addition to the danger to be apprehended
from his captors, he had constantly before
his mind this new cause for fear. The rustling of
the leaves, the flight of a bird as it sought a perch
for the night, or the soughing of the wind among the
branches were to him so many proofs that a violent
death would be his before morning.</p>

<p>If the beginning of the hours of darkness was so
terrible it can well be fancied how he suffered
before another day dawned.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>A NARROW ESCAPE.</i></p>

<p>Neither Teddy nor Dan had any hope of reaching
the museum tent before their pursuers
could overtake them, and although both knew what
might be the result if they were taken with the
jewelry fakir's money and goods in their possession,
they did not for a moment think of abandoning the
property.</p>

<p>The cries of those in the rear attracted the attention
of the spectators elsewhere on the grounds,
and without waiting to learn the cause of the trouble
hundreds of men and boys joined in the chase,
all shouting at the full strength of their lungs:</p>

<p>"Stop thief! Stop thief!"</p>

<p>The distance to be traversed was nearly a quarter
of a mile; but the many turns the boys were forced
to make in order to avoid those who were ready to
capture them doubled this, and they were yet very
far from the goal when a burly, red-faced man
jumped in front of them.<span class="pagenum">[163]</span></p>

<p>It seemed as if capture was inevitable; but Teddy
resorted to the last means of defense, and was successful.</p>

<p>Letting go his hold of the satchel he lowered his
head, leaped forward with full force, striking the
officious stranger full in the stomach.</p>

<p>The man, not anticipating such an attack at a
moment when he almost had his hands upon the
supposed thieves, was bowled over like a nine-pin,
and, jumping quickly aside, Teddy caught hold of
the satchel once more.</p>

<p>By this time both the boys were so nearly winded
that speech was well nigh impossible; but Dan
managed to gasp admiringly:</p>

<p>"You're a dandy, old fellow," and then, with one
supreme effort, increased his pace a trifle.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that there were no spectators in
front of Mr. Sweet's tent when the boys came in
sight of it. The barker was lounging in a chair
outside, and on catching a glimpse of the boys
recognized them immediately.</p>

<p>The crowd in pursuit would have told a duller
man than he professed to be that there had been
some serious trouble, and, running to meet the boys
as if to intercept them, he cried:</p>

<p>"Circle around the canvas, an' crawl underneath,
so's that gang won't see where you've gone!"</p>

<p>The fugitives understood the scheme at once, and
making a short detour as if to avoid him, dashed<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
under the guy-ropes at one end, gaining the interior
of the tent before the pursuers arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. Sweet had just started toward the flap to
ascertain the cause of the commotion when the
boys entered, and, thinking himself about to be
attacked, leaped quickly back as he seized an ironbound
stake.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, eh?" he said, on recognizing the
intruders. "What's up? Are you the thieves
they're yellin' for?"</p>

<p>Teddy was hardly able to speak; but he held up
the satchel, as he panted:</p>

<p>"Hazelton's&mdash;they're killin' him&mdash;he&mdash;wants&mdash;this&mdash;saved."</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand it now. Jump into the
wagon an' get under the stuff there. I'll take the
valise. Them kind of fakirs are bound to come to
grief sooner or later, an' honest people get into a
muss tryin' to help 'em. I'd like to see the fair
where them kinds of games wasn't allowed; but
don't s'pose I ever shall, although it's always
promised."</p>

<p>While Mr. Sweet had been grumbling, and at the
same time concealing the satchel under the box
containing the snakes, the boys were doing their
best to hide themselves beneath the litter of ropes
and canvas which had been carelessly thrown into
the wagon.</p>

<p>In the meantime the pursuers came up, discovered<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
the unpleasant fact that the fugitives were no
longer in sight, and began to parley with the
barker.</p>

<p>"I tried to catch 'em," the boys heard the latter
say; "but they got around the tent before I had
time to find out what the matter was."</p>

<p>"They've gone inside!" one of the crowd shouted.
"Don't let's allow swindlers to get the best of us
so easy!"</p>

<p>"That's the way to talk!" another cried. "We'll
have 'em out if the show has to come down!"</p>

<p>At this moment Mr. Sweet, looking calm and undisturbed,
emerged from the flap.</p>

<p>"Bring out them boys, or down comes your tent!"
a man yelled.</p>

<p>"I reckon the wisest plan for you to pursue is to
wait till I find out what all this means," the proprietor
of the museum said loudly, at the same time
beckoning the barker and the clown to his side.
"It looks to me as if this was the same gang who
came here last night tryin' to clean us out, an' warrants
for their arrest are in the hands of the constables
now. I paid one hundred dollars for the
privilege of exhibitin' here, an' that means I'm to
have all the protection the managers of this fair
and the authorities of the town can give me. I've
warned you off; but if you still want to finish up
the work of last night, an' the constables don't come
in time, there are three of us here who are good for<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
twice that number of your gang, an' when a man
gets a tap over the head with one of these he's not
in it any longer!"</p>

<p>Mr. Sweet flourished the heavy stake as he spoke,
and his employes showed that they were armed in
the same manner.</p>

<p>"We didn't come to disturb you," one of the
crowd said, in a milder tone, as the greater number
fell back before the threats made of invoking the
aid of the law. "All we want is a valise two boys
brought here, for in it is quite a pile of our
money."</p>

<p>"How did they get it from you?" the proprietor
of the museum asked for the purpose of gaining
time in the hope the constables would put in an
appearance.</p>

<p>"We were swindled by a jewelry agent, an' are
goin' to get back our own."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are, eh? Well, I haven't got the stuff;
but if you allow yourselves to be swindled, will you
help matters by turning thieves? You can sue the
man who has done you up; but there's a penalty
for stealing, as you will find out if you keep on in
this way."</p>

<p>The less impetuous among the pursuers understood
that the showman was speaking only the
truth, and, now that they had an opportunity for reflection,
began to be ashamed of the part they were
playing. One by one walked away without making<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
any further remonstrance, and in a short time only
a dozen or so remained in front of the tent.</p>

<p>All these were young men, and several had been
drinking, therefore the danger was not yet past.</p>

<p>"You stand here and brain the first man who
attempts to enter," Mr. Sweet said, as he disappeared
inside the tent. Then hurrying to where
Teddy and Dan were hidden, he whispered:</p>

<p>"It may be possible that in order to avoid a row
I shall be obliged to let this gang in. There is no
one behind the canvas, and you can slip out readily.
Go directly back where you belong, an' if
anybody accuses you of being the boys who brought
away the valise deny it. I'm goin' to make a big
bluff about lookin' for constables, an' the minute
you hear me talking, move lively."</p>

<p>"What about Hazelton's money?" Teddy asked.</p>

<p>"He'll find it here when he dares to come for it."</p>

<p>An instant later the fugitives heard him say from
the outside:</p>

<p>"I propose to call for help in case you very
respectable young gentleman should take a notion
to break in and steal."</p>

<p>"All we ask is that you'll turn out them boys,"
one of the party replied, angrily, "for, whether it's
stealing or not, we're bound to have that fakir's
money."</p>

<p>"That part of it is nothing to me. There are no
boys inside, an' if you want to go in one at a time,<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
so there'll be no chance of gettin' the best of me an'
destroyin' my property, I don't think there'll be
any objection made."</p>

<p>"Now's our time before they come?" Dan whispered,
as he slipped softly down from the wagon,
and Teddy followed.</p>

<p>It was but the work of a moment to raise the
canvas and step out. There was absolutely no one
in sight. The tent had been erected near the edge
of the grounds, and there was nothing in the vicinity
to attract the sightseers.</p>

<p>"We'll get over the fence, an' come in through
the main gate. It's better to pay for admission
than to let people suspect we were the ones who
have been chased."</p>

<p>"Go on; I'll stay close at your heels."</p>

<p>Five minutes later they were walking along the
dusty road looking as innocent as possible, and
feeling comparatively safe.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose any one will know us?" Teddy
asked after they had trudged some distance in
silence.</p>

<p>"There can't be much danger of that. All the
crowd saw were our backs, and, besides, after those
fellows cool off they'll be ashamed of themselves.
I don't reckon you'll have any trouble; but I may
get it hot from the boss because I've been away so
long."</p>

<p>"I guess there won't be much danger of that;<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
but if anything should happen come to my stand.
After what has happened I reckon I can afford to
whack up with you on some of the profits, especially
since every one says to-morrow is to be such a big
day. Where do you suppose Hazelton is?"</p>

<p>"He must have had a chance to get off when the
men started for us; but I'll bet he don't look as
nice as he did this morning."</p>

<p>By this time the boys were at the ticket-office,
and, paying the price of admission, they walked into
the inclosure without attracting the slightest attention.</p>

<p>On the way to his place of business Teddy
chanced to think of the errand on which they had
started out, and he bought a generous supply of
sandwiches for Dan, Tim, and himself.</p>

<p>When the two arrived at the cane-board business
was at its height, and the clerk and his assistant
were having quite as much as they could do to
attend to the customers.</p>

<p>This saved Teddy the necessity of entering into
any explanation while strangers were near, and
he immediately went to work, not having an idle
moment until nearly nightfall, when the greater
portion of the visitors had departed.</p>

<p>"Where did you and Dan go that you staid away
so long?" Tim asked as he and Teddy began to
pack up the stock of canes and knives.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a long story; I'll tell you all about it<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
while we are eating supper," Teddy replied, with a
significant look in the direction of the assistant.</p>

<p>Tim understood that there was some secret
regarding the matter, and he at once proceeded to
get rid of a possible eavesdropper by saying to the
assistant:</p>

<p>"Here's the money I promised. There's no need
of your stayin' any longer."</p>

<p>"Shall I come to work in the morning?"</p>

<p>Tim looked toward his employer, and the latter
said:</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, if it is pleasant weather. Everybody
says there'll be a bigger crowd than ever, an'
I reckon we shall have work enough for all hands."</p>

<p>The boy had but just taken his departure when
Dan approached, looking very mournful.</p>

<p>"Have you been bounced?" Teddy cried, excitedly.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it; but look here," and Dan held up
a straw hat. "That's poor Sam's! His boat has been
found bottom up, an' this, with one of the oars,
was fished out of the creek a few moments ago.
While we were talking rough about him the poor
boy was drowning!"</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>THE ARREST.</i></p>

<p>Teddy was dazed by the tidings and apparent
proof of Sam's death. Without being able to explain
why, it seemed as if the amateur detective
was not the sort of a boy who might be expected
to depart this life suddenly, and the news saddened
him wonderfully.</p>

<p>"Just think," he said, "the poor fellow wouldn't
try to save the women because of the danger of
approaching a drowning person, and in such a
short time he himself is at the bottom of the creek."</p>

<p>"If he has got any folks some word ought to be
sent to them."</p>

<p>"I never heard him say whether he had or not.
Will any one search for the body?"</p>

<p>"The man who represents the Davis Company
says he will have men out in the morning, if it is
possible to hire any; if not, there will be plenty
wanting a job by Saturday, and he can then get
all he wants. It's bound to be a long search, for
there's no telling where the boat capsized."</p>

<p>Nothing save Sam's untimely fate was spoken of
during the time they were packing up the goods<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
and carrying them to the tent, and then Mr. Sweet,
after having been told the sad news, said, without
commenting upon it:</p>

<p>"You boys had better go to supper now, an' get
back before dark, for there's no knowin' but that
some of those fellows who called on me may be
waiting to take their revenge out on you."</p>

<p>"How did you get rid of them?" Dan asked.</p>

<p>"That part of it was as easy as rollin' off a log,
after you boys were out of sight. I let 'em in one
at a time, an' the chumps never tumbled to the fact
that you had gone under the canvas. They came to
the conclusion you must have climbed over the
fence, an' we didn't take the trouble to show them
the mistake. It was a close shave, though. At one
time, when I was talkin' so loud about stealing, I
thought we'd have the toughest kind of a row."</p>

<p>"Is the money all right?"</p>

<p>"It's jest where I left it, an' won't be touched
till he comes to claim it, unless you boys want to
take charge of the property."</p>

<p>"Indeed we don't," Teddy replied, quickly. "I've
had all I want of such caretaking."</p>

<p>"Then go to supper, an' hurry back."</p>

<p>The boys waited only long enough to stow their
goods in the wagon, and then Mr. Sweet's advice
was acted upon.</p>

<p>As a matter of course Tim wanted to know what
the proprietor of the museum had been talking<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
about, and as they were walking across the grounds
Teddy told the whole story, concluding by saying:</p>

<p>"It was a little the worst scrape I ever got into;
but after the money had been placed in our hands,
and the man who left it went off, we couldn't do
different from what we did."</p>

<p>"That Hazelton had no business to get you into
such a row," Tim replied, indignantly. "Why
didn't he hang on to the stuff, an' take his lickin'
like a man?"</p>

<p>"I don't think he knew it was to be given to us.
The fellow who did it had seen him leave the
satchel with us once, most likely, an' when there
was danger of being robbed, believed we could look
out for it again. It's the last time such a thing will
happen, for I'm going to tell Hazelton that I don't
want to be mixed up in his business."</p>

<p>At this point Dan changed the subject of conversation
by speculating upon the way in which Sam
met his death, and this topic was such a mournful
one that nothing else was thought of until the party
returned to the tent once more.</p>

<p>Then came the question of how much money had
been taken in during the day, and after figuring
up the amount he had spent, Teddy reckoned the
cash on hand, announcing the result as follows:</p>

<p>"Countin' what I paid out, we've taken sixty-one
dollars an' seventy cents since morning. It don't<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
seem reasonable, but a feller has to believe it after
seein' the money."</p>

<p>"You'll have a much better trade to-morrow,
if it is fair, and you're not recognized as one of the
boys who helped to get Hazelton's money away,"
Mr. Sweet said, cheerily. "I predict that the receipts
will figure up hard on to a hundred dollars."</p>

<p>Teddy gasped like a person who is suddenly
submerged in cold water at the thought of earning
so much, and he realized that if such should be the
case he would be able to assist his mother very
materially.</p>

<p>"I'll pay you, Tim, before I get so dazzled as to
forget it," he said, with a laugh, and the clerk felt
almost as rich as his employer when he received
six dollars and seventeen cents for a day's labor
which came very near being sport.</p>

<p>"I only wish the fair held on for six months," he
said gleefully. "It seems too bad that there are
only two days more, for Saturday never counts."</p>

<p>"You can go to the Holtown fair, and try it for
yourself. I'll give you what stock we have left on
hand."</p>

<p>"Then I'll do it," Tim replied, emphatically, and
straightway he began to speculate as to the enormous
amount of money he would earn.</p>

<p>Teddy tied his money in as compact a package as
possible, intending to give it to his mother when
she should arrive on the morrow, and Mr. Sweet<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
had advised that all hands "turn in" early, when
the flap was raised, admitting a man who appeared
to be covered with adhesive plaster and bandages.</p>

<p>Not until the newcomer had approached within
the circle of light cast by the lantern did the occupants
of the tent recognize him as the jewelry fakir,
and Teddy cried in surprise:</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Hazelton! We didn't expect to see
you to-night!"</p>

<p>"Did you think I was dead?"</p>

<p>"It looked as if you would be killed for a certainty,
and you did get pretty well done up."</p>

<p>"Yes; as the reports of the prize fights put it, 'I'm
badly disfigured, but still in the ring.' Was the
money taken away all right?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Sweet has hidden it."</p>

<p>"And how did you come out of the scrape?"</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been for the folks here we should
have fared about the same as you did."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, my boy, that you were dragged into
the matter, and it wouldn't have happened if I'd
understood what Kelly was going to do. He knew
you could be trusted, and so turned it over; but it
was a mean situation to put you in."</p>

<p>"It wasn't pleasant for any of us," Mr. Sweet
said; "but you can thank the boys for hanging on
to the bag as if it had been their own. Most fellows
of their age would have dropped it long before
reaching here. How did you get off?"<span class="pagenum">[176]</span></p>

<p>"When the cry was raised that the money had
gone the greater portion of the crowd started in
pursuit, an' my partners and I managed to hold
our own until a couple of constables came up. They
took charge of the team, and gave us a chance to
slip through the gates."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do now? Try it to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"With this face? Well, I should say not. There
is a fellow here who has bought my right to the
privilege, and I shall leave Peach Bottom early in
the morning."</p>

<p>"That's about the best thing you can do, and I'd
advise that you don't spend much time out of doors
until then."</p>

<p>"I'm not intending to. It was necessary to come
here, and, unless you object, I'll stay a while so's
they will have time to sober up a bit."</p>

<p>"You're welcome to what we've got, even if I
don't like your way of doing business."</p>

<p>"I want to straighten matters with the boys, and
if they&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hazelton did not finish the sentence, for at that
moment the canvas flap was pushed aside and a
man entered with an unmistakable air of authority.</p>

<p>"Hold on there, friend," Mr. Sweet shouted. "We
don't allow visitors at this time of night."</p>

<p>"I understand that, but reckon you won't make
any very big kick when I tell you that I'm one of<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
the deputy sheriffs of this county, and have come
to serve a warrant."</p>

<p>"On whom?"</p>

<p>"Frank Hazelton, who claims to be an agent for a
firm of jewelry manufacturers. I believe you're the
man," he added, approaching the disfigured fakir.</p>

<p>"You've got that part of it straight enough, but
what am I to be arrested for?"</p>

<p>"You are suspected of being concerned in the
burglary which was committed in this town last
night."</p>

<p>Hazelton did not express nearly as much surprise
as the boys, who were really dazed by the announcement.</p>

<p>"So Hargreaves has finally succeeded," the fakir
said half to himself, and the officer replied, quickly:</p>

<p>"This has nothing to do with old Nathan's affair,
although it does look as if the two burglaries were
committed by the same person."</p>

<p>Hazelton remained silent several seconds, during
which time the sheriff waited patiently for him to
say he was ready to go, and then he asked:</p>

<p>"Can I speak to one of these boys in private. It
has nothing to do with the charge, but I want him
to aid me in getting a good lawyer."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say I must hear all that is talked
about, however trifling it may be."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't suppose it can make much difference,"
and without rising from his seat, Hazelton<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
continued, "Teddy, you believe I had nothing to do
with this thing?"</p>

<p>"I can tell what I heard those&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't tell anything yet a while; at least, not
now. I want you to do this for me: After the fair
closes go to that merchant who was so kind to you,
and explain to him the whole affair, including your
suspicions. Ask him to direct you to the best attorney
in the county; get all the money from Mr.
Sweet that may be needed, and pay the lawyer's
fee. Send him to me as soon afterward as possible.
It is nothing more serious than lying in jail a few
days, and that won't be such a great hardship, now
I've got this face on me."</p>

<p>"Shall I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no need of saying anything more," Hazelton
interrupted, fearing the boy was about to
speak of the money the proprietor of the museum
had hidden. "The merchant will understand and
advise if you tell him everything&mdash;that is, I think
he will; but in case he refuses, talk with some one
else whom you can trust."</p>

<p>As he finished speaking the fakir arose to his
feet, motioned to the officer, and walked directly
out of the tent without so much as bidding the others
goodby.</p>

<p>No one spoke until after he had been absent several
minutes, and then Teddy asked, with a long-drawn
sigh:<span class="pagenum">[179]</span></p>

<p>"Do you think he will come out all right, Mr.
Sweet?"</p>

<p>"That's hard to say, for I don't know how much
proof they may have against him. It's his business
that has done a great deal toward inducing a magistrate
to issue the warrant, for once a man shows
himself to be a swindler, anything else can readily
be believed of him."</p>

<p>"But what about his money?" Dan asked.</p>

<p>"That is to be handed over to Teddy."</p>

<p>"What have I got to do with it?" the boy asked,
in amazement.</p>

<p>"He told us that as plainly as he dared to talk before
the officer, and we'll count it out, after which
his stock in trade shall be buried, for I want nothing
to do with it."</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>A PROPOSITION.</i></p>

<p>Teddy had the most decided objections to taking
charge of Hazelton's money, and for several
reasons. In the first place he did not want to have
the responsibility, and again, the fact of its being in
his possession seemed to make him a partner in the
business.</p>

<p>Mr. Sweet was determined, however. He insisted
that Hazelton had stated this as plainly as was possible
under the circumstances, and, despite the boy's
protests, immediately began the transfer.</p>

<p>"It shall be done in such a way that he can't accuse
you of having taken any," the proprietor said,
as he pulled the satchel from its hiding-place and
broke the lock open with a hatchet. "We'll count
it in the presence of all hands, and each one shall
give Teddy a written statement of how much was
found."</p>

<p>An exclamation of surprise burst from Tim's lips
as the receptacle was spread out on the ground, for
it appeared to be literally crammed with money.</p>

<p>Mr. Sweet separated the silver from the bank<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
notes, spreading both on the ground where they
could be seen by every person present, and then he
counted them slowly, taking care that the spectators
were following his every movement.</p>

<p>"I make it three hundred an' forty-eight dollars,"
he announced. "If there's anybody here who ain't
sure that's right, say so now."</p>

<p>Each member of the party had seen the amount
counted, and agreed with the result as declared by
Mr. Sweet, who forthwith wrote the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>We, the undersigned, have seen a valise belonging
to Frank Hazelton broken open, and certify
that three hundred and forty-eight dollars, the only
money found therein, was handed by Jacob Sweet
to Edward Hargreaves in conformance with the orders,
as we understood them, from the said Frank
Hazelton.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Now I want every one to sign that," Mr. Sweet
said, as he handed his lead-pencil first to the barker,
"and then Teddy and I will have some proof of the
amount."</p>

<p>It required quite a while for all to conform with
the wishes of the proprietor of the museum, owing
to the fact that several of the party were far from
being skillful penmen, but the task was finally accomplished,
and as the money was handed to Teddy,
the latter asked, ruefully:</p>

<p>"What shall I do with it? I'm afraid of losing so
much."</p>

<p>"That's a risk Hazelton is bound to take. Fasten<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
it in your clothes somehow, an' be sure you don't
get into any row where it can be stolen."</p>

<p>By the aid of many pins, and with the assistance
of both Dan and Tim, Teddy finally succeeded in
disposing of the money about his person in such a
way that it was not an unusual burden, and then Mr.
Sweet insisted that all hands should try to get some
rest in order to be fresh for the supposedly enormous
amount of work to be done on the following
day.</p>

<p>Teddy lay down on the ground with the others,
but it was many hours before his eyes were closed
in slumber. Sam's untimely death, the guardianship
of so much money, and his own business affairs
all served to keep his eyes open until nearly midnight,
when he fell into a sleep so troubled by frightful
dreams that it was far from being restful.</p>

<p>It seemed as if he had but just lost consciousness
when Mr. Sweet aroused him with the information
that the "big" day of the fair was breaking.</p>

<p>"Turn out an' get your breakfast before sunrise, for
on this morning the early bird will pick up many a
penny while the lazy ones are yet in bed, an' fakirs
must make hay when the sun shines."</p>

<p>Teddy was on his feet in an instant, and half an
hour later, having broken his fast, he was at the
booth with his clerk and Dan, the latter volunteering
his assistance until the exhibition buildings
should be opened.<span class="pagenum">[183]</span></p>

<p>The proprietor of the museum had advised him
well; the receipts of the cane and knife boards were
nearly five dollars before more than half of the
booths were in condition for trade, because the
trains were running unusually early in order to accommodate
the crowds, and when Dan felt obliged
to leave, business was so good that the proprietor,
clerk, and assistant were all working industriously.</p>

<p>"If I can get off I'll see you about noon," Dan
said, as he walked away, and Teddy replied:</p>

<p>"Be sure to come, for mother will be here, and I
want you to meet her."</p>

<p>From that time until nine o'clock the crowd increased
in numbers, and as Teddy said during a lull
in business, "it seemed as if the grounds were so
full that no more could get in."</p>

<p>When Mrs. Hargreaves arrived her son could pay
little attention to her, but he proposed that she
should amuse herself by looking at the different exhibits
until nearly noon, when he stated that he
would take an hour off, no matter how great a rush
of customers might be around his booth.</p>

<p>"I earned sixty dollars yesterday, an' before
night I'll have a hundred more, so there's little
doubt that this week's work as a fakir will enable
me to pay all you owe on the house," he whispered,
triumphantly, and his mother walked away,
hardly daring to believe what Teddy had told her.</p>

<p>During the next hour it seemed as if a steady<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
stream of money was flowing into the box, and
Teddy was feeling confident that Mr. Sweet's prediction
would prove to be correct, when the one
especial man he wanted to see came up with a
folded paper in his hand.</p>

<p>It was the merchant from Waterville, and he
said, as he handed the document to the boy:</p>

<p>"Here is the receipted bill, and I am more than
glad to see you doing so well."</p>

<p>"Can I talk with you for five minutes?" Teddy
asked, hardly noticing the paper as he put it in his
pocket.</p>

<p>"As long as you want to. What is the matter?
Running out of stock?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, your clerk made such a good selection
for me that I've got all I shall need. This is something
more important."</p>

<p>Then Teddy hurriedly told the merchant how and
where he had first met Hazelton; explained fully
what the latter's business was; of the accusations
made by Uncle Nathan; what he and Dan had
heard and seen, and concluded by repeating the request
made by the fakir as he was led away to jail.</p>

<p>"Are you willing to do anything for him?" the
boy asked, as his story was finished.</p>

<p>"I can't say it is a matter which appeals very
strongly to my sympathies, because of the swindles
he perpetrated, but if it is an unjust accusation
something should be done to help him. The one<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
lawyer above all others who can be of assistance
came over with me this morning. I will see him,
and later in the day you shall have a call from us."</p>

<p>"Before you go I wish you would take this
money," Teddy said, earnestly. "It is too large an
amount for me to carry around, and it will be safe
with you."</p>

<p>The merchant consented to take charge of Hazelton's
ill-gotten gains, and Teddy felt decidedly relieved
when the cash was in another's keeping, and
he had nothing of more value than an acknowledgment
of the same to look after.</p>

<p>"In this matter I shall recognize no other order
than yours," the merchant said when the transaction
was concluded, "and if the fakir should succeed
in regaining his liberty he must come to you
for the necessary document.</p>

<p>"I don't care how it is fixed so long as the money
is not in my hands," Teddy replied, in a tone of satisfaction,
and then he was called upon to attend to
another rush of customers, every one of whom was
eager to be waited upon first.</p>

<p>Another hour passed, and it was more evident
than before that Mr. Sweet had been correct when
he stated the sum which should be taken in at the
cane-board.</p>

<p>Teddy, having breakfasted early, was so hungry
that he was on the point of going out to buy a supply
of sandwiches, when another visitor arrived.<span class="pagenum">[186]</span></p>

<p>This was no less a personage than Uncle Nathan,
and he greeted his nephew with the utmost cordiality,
as he said:</p>

<p>"It looks to me as if you were makin' a power of
money here, Teddy. I had no idea these triflin'
games would so attract the people."</p>

<p>Glad to be on pleasant terms with the old man
once more, Teddy stated that they had been at
work very hard since the first train arrived, and
concluded by saying:</p>

<p>"I took over sixty dollars yesterday, and Mr.
Sweet says it'll come near to a hundred to-day."</p>

<p>"Sixty dollars!" the old man cried. "Are you
telling me the truth, Teddy Hargreaves?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am, an' I've got the money in my
pocket to prove it."</p>

<p>"Why, at this rate you'll soon be a rich man, for
you don't seem to lose much of the stock."</p>

<p>"We buy a good many canes or knives back.
When a man puts a ring over one that he don't
want we take it in, and give him five more chances.
In that way there is very little goes out compared
to the amount of money received."</p>

<p>Uncle Nathan looked around at the players for a
moment, and then in a very confidential tone he
whispered:</p>

<p>"See here, Teddy, don't you want a partner? I'll
pay for the stock you bought, an'&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum">[187]</span></p>

<p>"I've already done that out of yesterday's receipts,"
Teddy cried. "All the bills are settled, an'
what comes in now is clear profit."</p>

<p>"But suppose I stood here an' called up the people
I know, don't you think it would make business
better?"</p>

<p>"And if it should, do you think we could attend
to more customers? Every minute I talk with you
is so much money lost, for the other fellers can't
pick up rings an' make change fast enough."</p>

<p>"Does that mean you don't want to go into business
with me?" the old man asked, angrily.</p>

<p>"No; but it means that there would be no reason
for doing such a thing. I've got no debts, an' there
are more customers than can be attended to on so
small a board. If you'd made the proposition last
Monday it would have been different, but now you
can't expect me, after taking all the risk, to divide
after the work has been done."</p>

<p>"Who lent you the money to start, Teddy Hargreaves?"
Uncle Nathan cried, his face growing
purple with rage.</p>

<p>"You did."</p>

<p>"And how have you repaid such generosity?
How&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I gave you three dollars for the use of fifteen
two days," was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>"But how have you repaid me for remaining inactive
after my money was stolen?"<span class="pagenum">[188]</span></p>

<p>"That was something which did not concern me,
therefore I had nothing to repay."</p>

<p>"It has a great deal to do with you, as shall be
shown before this day is ended, unless you consent
to take me as an equal partner in this enterprise.
Your friend in crime has been arrested, and I can
swear that he turned over to you his ill-gotten
gains. One word from me at this time and you will
be in the same prison."</p>

<p>The fact of his having been threatened before
made Teddy bold, and he said, quietly:</p>

<p>"I won't pay you for holding your tongue, Uncle
Nathan, so do whatever you choose."</p>

<p>"I will inform the authorities of all I have learned
this morning, and we shall see what the result will
be," the old man cried, in a fury, as he walked
away, and despite the bold bearing he had assumed
Teddy firmly believed that if the magistrate who issued
the warrant for Hazelton's arrest should know
he was in possession of the fakir's money, he would
be brought before a bar of justice to explain matters.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="h3">WITH THE BURGLARS.</p>

<p>It is well to look in upon Sam during his enforced
vigil of Wednesday night.</p>

<p>For at least two hours after the burglars had departed
he thought of nothing save that he would
soon be killed, and, perhaps, devoured by wild animals.
Then the pain in his jaw and limbs became
so great, owing to the tightly bound cords and his
inability to move, that his sufferings overcame the
fear to a certain extent, and he had not even the
poor consolation of being able to give vent to an
audible groan.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the mental and bodily torture
he did sleep occasionally during the night, which
appeared to be of twenty-four hours' duration,
and never had he heard a sweeter sound than
when his captors approached, the hum of their
voices reaching him before the noise of their footsteps.</p>

<p>The burglars were laden with packages of what
appeared to be merchandise, and by the faint light<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
of the coming day Sam could see that they looked
heated and tired.</p>

<p>"Well, how's our detective?" Long Jim asked,
with a laugh, as he threw himself on the ground by
the boy's side. "Has he decided to arrest his victims,
or will he give them a little show of leaving
the country?"</p>

<p>As a matter of course Sam could not make any
reply; but the expression in his eyes must have told
of the suffering which he was forced to endure, for
Phil said, as he began to untie the rope holding the
gag in place:</p>

<p>"There's no need of keepin' him trussed up any
longer, an' I reckon it'll be a relief to have a chance
to use his tongue once more."</p>

<p>Even when he was free the prisoner was unable
to do more than roll upon his side. His limbs were
so stiff and cramped that he had no power over
them, and he could not have risen to his feet just
at that moment if his life had depended upon it.</p>

<p>Jim seemed to think all this was very comical, for
he laughed loudly at the prisoner's helplessness,
and suggested that if he intended to follow the
business of a detective to practice remaining in one
position in order to avoid such a complete collapse
when fortune should again be so unkind to him as
she had been in this particular case.</p>

<p>When the burglar's mirth finally ceased the two
men lighted their pipes, and proceeded to enjoy a<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
season of repose after so much fatiguing work,
while Sam was left to recover as best he might.</p>

<p>Fully half an hour elapsed before he succeeded in
crawling to the brook where he quenched his thirst,
and then his one desire was for sleep.</p>

<p>Stretched out on the ground within a few feet of
his captors the blissful unconsciousness of slumber
came upon him, and the sun was high in the heavens
before he awoke.</p>

<p>Long Jim was seated on the turf, his back against
a tree, and a quantity of food spread out in front of
him; but Phil was not in sight.</p>

<p>"Well, it strikes me you've been takin' things
mighty comfortable," the man said, with a grunt.
"Don't give yourself so far over to a life of pleasure
as to forget that I promised to give you the greatest
floggin' of your life before we part, for then you
won't be so much surprised when it comes."</p>

<p>The sight of the food caused Sam to realize how
very hungry he was, and, regardless of the subject
introduced by Jim, he asked, timidly:</p>

<p>"Can't I have somethin' to eat?"</p>

<p>"I don't think you can, my son. In the first
place you haven't earned it, an' then, again, my
partner an' I may need all the grub we've got on
hand."</p>

<p>Then, as if reconsidering his determination, the
man selected two small crackers, tossing them to
Sam as he cut a slice of boiled ham for himself.<span class="pagenum">[192]</span></p>

<p>"That's more'n you deserve," he said, as the
prisoner began to devour them eagerly; "so don't
count on gettin' another bite to-day."</p>

<p>Sam literally devoured the food, and then went
once more to the brook to wash down the dry
repast.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the crackers increased rather
than satisfied his hunger, and he watched Jim
eagerly as the latter finished a generous meal of
meat, cheese, and hard-boiled eggs.</p>

<p>The burglar lighted his pipe, and paid no attention
to the hungry boy, who now had ample time
for reflection.</p>

<p>He remembered that this was the important day
of the fair, and pictured to himself Teddy and Dan
at their work enjoying themselves at the same
time they were making money. Then he thought
of what he might be doing if the detective fever
had not taken so firm a hold upon him, and, despite
all efforts to prevent it, the tears coursed down his
cheeks, plowing wide furrows in the dirt with
which his face was encrusted.</p>

<p>This painful revery was not prolonged. Shortly
before noon Phil came into the hiding-place, his
face wearing an expression of entire satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I reckon we needn't be afraid any one will be
here lookin' for us now our detective has been
drowned," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"What's up?" Jim asked.<span class="pagenum">[193]</span></p>

<p>"Hazelton, the fakir, has been arrested for the
burglary at Peach Bottom, an' men are draggin'
the creek to find the body of the boy who worked
for the Davis Boat Company."</p>

<p>Sam actually shuddered at the thought that people
were looking for his corpse, and it gave him an
"uncanny" feeling, this idea that he was numbered
with the dead.</p>

<p>"When was the arrest made?" Jim asked.</p>

<p>"Last night. Old Nathan from the Run says the
fakir turned over a lot of money to the boy who
was goin' to buy your cane-board, an' it looks very
much as if he would be locked up with the man
whom people believe is his partner."</p>

<p>"Nothin' said about what the cubs saw at the
barn?"</p>

<p>"Not a word."</p>

<p>"Then we can count on havin' the balance of this
week in which to leave the country."</p>

<p>"As much as that, if not more. Another load will
get the stuff together; but I've been thinkin' we'd
better bury it here, an' not try to move a thing for
a month or two."</p>

<p>"In that case we'd be obliged to take that specimen
along," and Jim pointed with a contemptuous
gesture toward Sam. "It wouldn't do to let go of
him while there was a chance of his givin' the
game away."</p>

<p>"I'll 'tend to that part of it, an' guarantee he<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
won't be in condition to make us much trouble,"
Phil said so confidently that Sam began to shake
as with an ague fit, for it seemed positive to him
this burglar had decided upon his murder.</p>

<p>"If things were so comfortable like why don't
you try to make a dollar, for I reckon there's a big
crowd at the fair?"</p>

<p>"The grounds are packed; but it ain't exactly
safe to do much business," and Phil told of the
assault upon Hazelton. "The whole boilin' of 'em
now think everybody's tryin' to work some swindle,"
he added, "an' the consequence is that it
would go hard with any feller who should slip up.
We've done enough for one week, an' I'd rather
not take chances till this stuff is off our hands."</p>

<p>"Do you count on goin' back agin to-day?"</p>

<p>"What's the use?"</p>

<p>"I only asked, for you're managin' this whole
thing now."</p>

<p>"My idea was to sneak up alone to-night; take
on the balance of the stuff, an' then lay low till
Saturday evenin', when we'll make the big break."</p>

<p>"It's goin' to be mighty dull business sittin' here
with nothin' to do," Jim replied, in a tone of complaint.</p>

<p>"I don't see how we can fix it much quicker,
unless we go to-morrow, while there are so many
around."</p>

<p>It was evident Jim did not relish the idea of<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
leaving everything to his companion, and the latter
so understood the expression on his friend's face,
for he said, angrily:</p>

<p>"You're cookin' up some foolish scheme now,
an' in spite of all I can do to prevent it we'll probably
succeed in gettin' nabbed before matters are
arranged as they should be."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're too smart, that's what ails you.
Take all the soft snaps, an' leave me here to suck
my thumbs without even the chance of movin'
around."</p>

<p>"If you think it's sich a snap to row up there an'
back, why don't you try your hand."</p>

<p>"That's jest what I'm willin' to do. Anything's
better'n stayin' here, an' I'd like you to have a
taste of it."</p>

<p>Sam, who was expecting each moment to see the
thieves come to blows, understood at once that this
arrangement did not please Phil; but he made no
further objection than to say:</p>

<p>"If you wasn't so blamed careless I'd like to have
you do a share of the hard work; but it's ten to one
you'll contrive to let everybody know you are
there."</p>

<p>"I may not be so all-fired smart as you think you
are, but I ain't quite a fool. Why, I've managed
bigger things than this when you was around beggin'
for something' to eat, 'cause you was too
chicken-hearted to do this kind of work."<span class="pagenum">[196]</span></p>

<p>"You'd better not say too much; I've stuck by
you when worse men would have a' given you the
cold shake, an' don't intend to take any guff, especially
since I've had sich hard work to get us out
of the scrape you jumped into."</p>

<p>"I shall talk, an' if you don't want to listen, there
are plenty of places to lay off in outside of this."</p>

<p>Then the two thieves glared at each other several
moments in silence, and finally Phil said, with a
mirthless laugh:</p>

<p>"We won't fight till this job is finished. Go an'
get the balance of the stuff, an' we'll make a break
whenever you are ready; but after one pull up an'
back there'll be somebody besides me who'll think
it hard work."</p>

<p>Then, in order to heal the breach which had
opened between them, Phil produced a suspicious
looking black bottle from his pocket, and handed it
without comment to his partner.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you bring this out before, an' then,
perhaps, the business would 'a' looked different?"
Jim growled, as he drank long and deep; "but it
won't make any difference about my goin' up the
creek."</p>

<p>"That's all right; I'm satisfied."</p>

<p>As the two men began to drink a great hope
sprang up in Sam's heart that they would become
so stupefied by the liquor that he might make his
escape. They had not thought it necessary to<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
replace the bonds which had cost him so much
suffering, and at the first signs of unconsciousness
he resolved to make one dash for liberty, either by
taking to the boat, or attempting to make his way
toward the fair grounds on that side of the creek.</p>

<p>There was no such good fortune in store for the
prisoner, however. The men drank themselves
into the most friendly humor, and then the supply
of liquor was exhausted.</p>

<p>After advising Jim not to start until sunset, Phil
lay down to sleep, and Sam thought it wise to feign
slumber also, lest the wakeful burglar should take
it into his head to administer the promised flogging
in order to pass the time more agreeably.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>A DISASTER.</i></p>

<p>Teddy was decidedly uncomfortable in mind
after Uncle Nathan departed. By a combination
of circumstances which could not well have been
avoided, he had been made to appear as a confederate
of Hazelton, and if all the facts concerning
his relations with the fakir should become known
public opinion would he against him.</p>

<p>He did not allow these forebodings to interfere
with business, however. Customers were plenty;
the nickels were coming in as rapidly as he could
make change, and Tim had no hesitancy in saying
that Mr. Sweet had set their receipts of one day
considerably too low.</p>

<p>"We've done twice as much as we did yesterday
at this time, an' I'm countin' on gettin' twelve or
fifteen dollars as my share of this day's work."</p>

<p>"It looks as though you wouldn't be disappointed,
and that's a fact. I wish I knew where
we could get a few more canes, for we've lost quite
a good many this morning."</p>

<p>"There's no time to go to Waterville; but we<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
can shorten the board by putting the uprights
closer together, an' that'll make the layout look all
right. Here comes your mother, an' if you want to
go off with her I'll promise to keep things goin'
here."</p>

<p>That was exactly what Teddy did want to do.
He felt that it was necessary she should know the
true condition of affairs, and he could not talk with
her confidentially near the cane-board, therefore
when she came up he proposed that they walk
toward the grand stand, where the Waterville
band was doing its best to put in the shade the
performances of the musicians from the Run.</p>

<p>"You are looking worried, Teddy," Mrs. Hargreaves
said, as they moved away in the proposed
direction. "What is the matter? Isn't business as
good as you expected?"</p>

<p>"It is a great deal better; but Uncle Nathan has
been here again, and this time I'm afraid it is in his
power to do me some harm."</p>

<p>Then Teddy told his mother all that had happened,
explaining in detail the suspicions which
might be aroused against him, and she was quite
as disturbed as he when the recital was finished.</p>

<p>"I will talk with him myself," she said, after
some thought.</p>

<p>"Don't do anything of the kind, for then he will
be worse than ever, thinking he can frighten me
into giving half of all I have made, and that I<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
won't do, no matter how many warrants he gets
out."</p>

<p>"But Teddy, don't you think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Hargreaves was interrupted by a cry from a
half-intoxicated man who halted directly in front
of the young fakir, and shouted to some of his companions
in the rear:</p>

<p>"Here he is! This is the sneak who helped take
that jewelry swindler's money away. I saw him
then, an' can swear to his face."</p>

<p>As a matter of course the tone as well as the
words was sufficient to attract a crowd in this
place where the throng was so dense that one could
only make his way from one portion of the grounds
to the other with the greatest difficulty, and for a
moment, while Teddy stood unable to decide what
should be said or done, every person looked at him
threateningly.</p>

<p>"His partner has been arrested, an' we'll serve
him in the same way," the man continued, as he
advanced toward the boy.</p>

<p>"Why do you want to talk to me like that?"
Teddy cried, looking around in vain for a friend.
"There are plenty of people here who know me, for
I live down at the Run, an' never swindled anybody."</p>

<p>"That's a lie!" the man replied, fiercely, seizing
the boy by the collar.</p>

<p>"It's the truth!" Mrs. Hargreaves cried. "I'm
<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>his mother, and we have lived at the Run ever
since he was born. Deacon Jones is our neighbor,
and he can answer for the truth of it."</p>

<p class="caption">&quot;I tell you to let go of him. He is an acquaintance&quot;</p>

<p>"I'll see whether he can or not," and the bully
was about to drag Teddy away, aided by his half-intoxicated
friend, when a familiar voice from the
outskirts of the crowd cried:</p>

<p>"Hold on there! What are you about?"</p>

<p>"I've caught the feller what sneaked away the
jewelry swindler's money, an' am goin' to put him
with his partner."</p>

<p>"You are going to take your hand off his collar
this instant, or get yourself into trouble," and the
merchant from Waterville forced his way through
the throng until he stood by Teddy's side.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Mr. Reaves?" the bully asked, in
surprise. "Well, you don't want to interfere in
this business, for the boy is a bad one all the
way through. He was deep enough to get the
best of us yesterday; but he won't be so lucky
now."</p>

<p>"I tell you to let go of him. He is an acquaintance
of mine whom I would trust a good deal
sooner than some whom I see now."</p>

<p>"But you are makin' a big mistake, Mr. Reaves,
for I saw him makin' off with the valise where our
money had been put."</p>

<p>It was evident the bully had considerable respect
for the merchant, for he released his hold on Teddy;<span class="pagenum">[202]</span>
but was determined that the boy's alleged character
should be made known to all in the vicinity.</p>

<p>"I happen to know all about that affair," Mr.
Reaves replied, as he led Teddy and his mother out
of the throng, "and if you want the full particulars
of the affair come to my store when you are more
sober than now."</p>

<p>A very large number of those present were acquainted
with the merchant, and for the majority
his statement was sufficient to absolve Teddy of
wrongdoing; but a few, among whom were the
intoxicated party and his friends, vowed to sift the
matter more thoroughly before the fair came to an
end.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hargreaves was terribly excited, and at
once insisted that Teddy should go home with her
immediately, regardless of how much money he
was making; but Mr. Reaves said in a matter-of-fact
tone, as if such incidents were of everyday
occurrence:</p>

<p>"It would be foolish for him to do that, more
especially since it would be a tacit acknowledgment
of guilt, and, besides, his business here is too
valuable to be abandoned simply because a drunken
rowdy chooses to make trouble. I was on my way
to see him; I have found a lawyer who will under-take
Hazelton's case, and he can at the same time
give Teddy some good advice."</p>

<p>Then the merchant introduced Mr. Harvey as the<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
most prominent attorney in the county, and, offering
Mrs. Hargreaves his arm, added:</p>

<p>"We will go toward the cane-board, and give
them an opportunity to talk.</p>

<p>"There is a great deal to be said which cannot
interest us, and when they are done we shall be
readily found."</p>

<p>The widow could do no less than comply, and as
soon as they were comparatively alone the lawyer
said to Teddy:</p>

<p>"Now, I want you to begin and tell me the whole
story from the time your money was stolen until
this minute. Don't omit any particulars because
you may chance to think they are not important;
but give every detail, and thus I shall be made
acquainted with your own case as well as that of
Hazelton."</p>

<p>Teddy obeyed this command to the letter. He
dwelt upon the most minute transaction or trifling
movement at sufficient length to give the listener
a clear idea of all that had happened, and laid bare
his own business affairs, even to the extent of making
the lawyer acquainted with the amount of
receipts each day.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose it makes any difference what I
think," he said, in conclusion; "but I am almost
certain Mr. Hazelton did not have anything to do
with the robbery, and even if I had suspected him,
that which Dan and I heard while we were in the<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
museum tent would have convinced me that the
men whom we saw on the creek are the thieves."</p>

<p>"I believe as you do, my boy, and will send a man
to the barn you speak of this very night, although
so much time has now elapsed that I have no hope
of finding anything criminating. However, regardless
of what may happen, I believe we can show
that the fakir was not the guilty party, and, to
guard against a possible attack by your uncle, it
will be necessary to know exactly where we can
get bail in case you should be arrested."</p>

<p>"Then he can take me to jail?" Teddy asked,
with quivering lips.</p>

<p>"If he proves what he claims to know there is no
question that he will be able to cause your
arrest; but whether he can send you to prison is
an entirely different matter. I would now like to
have a talk with Mr. Reaves, and shall see you
before I leave the grounds. Do not be frightened;
but continue your business as usual, and in a few
moments I will give you full particulars as to what
must be done in the event anything happens."</p>

<p>Teddy understood this to be an intimation that
the interview was at an end, and he started toward
the cane-board, the lawyer asking as he followed
him:</p>

<p>"How shall I find your friend Dan?"</p>

<p>"Go down to the exhibit of the J. Stevens Arms
and Tool Company in that yellow-roofed building,<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
and you will see him showing model pocket rifles.
I will go with you if you think there is any chance
of missing him."</p>

<p>"I can find him without difficulty. Do not leave
your place of business until after I have seen you
again."</p>

<p>By this time they had arrived at the cane-board,
where Mrs. Hargreaves, looking decidedly relieved
in mind, was talking with Mr. Reaves.</p>

<p>The lawyer invited the merchant to accompany
him, and as the two walked away Mrs. Hargreaves
said:</p>

<p>"After talking with Mr. Reaves I will take back
what I proposed regarding taking you home. It
is not possible that anything but the right shall
conquer in a case like this, and I believe you will
come out all right, as a boy should who has always
been as obedient and loving as you. It is time for
me to be going now; but I will come back again in
the morning."</p>

<p>"Then take this money with you, for I don't
want any more in my pockets than is absolutely
necessary," and Teddy counted out the contents of
the box which served him as a "safe."</p>

<p>There was but little time for any lengthy leave-taking.
The customers were plenty; Tim and his
assistant had been working several hours without
cessation, and Teddy felt that it was his duty to
relieve them.<span class="pagenum">[206]</span></p>

<p>"You can trust Mr. Reaves, whatever happens,"
his mother said, as she kissed him goodby, "and I
shall be back to-morrow to learn if you are all
right."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about me," Teddy replied, cheerily.
"Uncle Nathan can't have everything his own
way, and he will soon discover that fact."</p>

<p>It seemed to Teddy that his mother had but just
left him, when a party of young men who had been
talking in an apparently friendly manner directly
in front of his place of business, suddenly began to
quarrel, and before he was aware of what had happened
his booth was overturned, and a fierce battle
being waged upon the ground which he fancied
belonged temporarily to him because of the money
paid to the managers of the fair as rent.</p>

<p>Canes, knives, rings, and timbers were thrown
violently about, and, while trying to save the property,
Teddy and his clerk received several severe
blows intended for some of the combatants.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>A SECOND ARREST.</i></p>

<p>When the fight began Teddy's first thought
was that it had been prearranged by some
one who wanted to do him an injury without taking
the chances of being arrested on a charge of malicious
mischief.</p>

<p>Tim believed it to be a scheme for robbing the
money box, and while the combatants were struggling
close around him he emptied the contents
into his trousers pockets, regardless of the chance
blows received meanwhile.</p>

<p>That both were wrong in their conjectures could
be told later, as the fight assumed the proportions
of a small riot, and the battle ground was soon
shifted to an open space in front of the exhibition
buildings.</p>

<p>It was nothing more than a causeless row such
as is often witnessed at fairs where intoxicating
beverages are sold, and which start from comparatively
nothing, illustrating the proverb: "See what
a great fire a little spark can kindle."</p>

<p>"This is goin' to knock our hundred dollars in the<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
head," Tim said, ruefully, as he began to gather up
the scattered stock when the combatants had
surged to and fro until they were some distance
from the wrecked cane-board. "It'll take an hour
to straighten things out, an' all that time will be the
same as lost."</p>

<p>"It might be worse," Teddy replied, philosophically,
"and, besides, we shouldn't be able to do any
business while that row is going on. If you hadn't
thought of the money it might have been lost, for
there were so many close around me that I couldn't
get at the box."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you want to pick somethin' good out of
the trouble, I'll help. This will give us a chance to
shorten the board so the stock won't look quite so
small."</p>

<p>The young fakirs were ready for business in
considerably less time than they had fancied would
be the case. Nearly every one on the grounds was
attracted by the riot, and among those who came
to the scene of the conflict was Dan.</p>

<p>Instead of watching the struggling, yelling
throng, he helped Teddy and Tim restore the booth
to order, and with such aid as the assistant could
give the work was done very quickly.</p>

<p>Before the spectators had quieted down sufficiently
to turn their attention to sport once more
everything was ready for business, and when the
constables had taken the ringleaders in the fight<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
away, money began once more to roll into Teddy's
coffers.</p>

<p>Before Dan returned to his own work he heard
of all that had occurred since morning, and his
comments on Uncle Nathan's behavior were more
forcible than polite.</p>

<p>"He's an old fool what oughter be rode on a rail
till he can't see, an' I'm goin' over to the Run before
I start for home jest to give the duffer a piece
of my mind."</p>

<p>"I don't believe that would do either you or him
any good," Teddy replied, laughingly.</p>

<p>"I don't know what effect it'll have on him; but
I'll feel a mighty sight better. He shows himself to
be the worst swindler on the grounds when he tries
to scare you into givin' him half you've made, for
that's what his talk means."</p>

<p>"If he don't do any worse than threaten I won't
say a word; but he's so mad there's no knowin'
what'll happen."</p>

<p>"The lawyer will see that you pull through all
right; but if trouble should come, be sure to send
for me. I'll manage to get off somehow."</p>

<p>With this assurance Dan hurried back to the
exhibition buildings, and Teddy was free to assist
Tim in waiting upon the customers.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the afternoon the young
fakirs had quite as much as they could attend to,
and then, just as trade had so fallen off that Tim<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
could wait upon the customers alone with the aid
of the assistant, Teddy received a call from Mr.
Harvey, the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Come here behind the booth where we can talk
without being overheard," he said, peremptorily,
and the boy obeyed at once, asking before the attorney
had time to speak:</p>

<p>"Do you know if Uncle Nathan is goin' to do anything?"</p>

<p>"He is certainly trying very hard, and in case he
should succeed in getting a warrant, you will demand
of the officer who serves it to be taken directly
to Deacon Jones. Mr. Reaves and I have
just had a talk with him, and in our absence he will
render such assistance as you may require."</p>

<p>"That sounds as if you believed Uncle Nathan
would be able to do as he threatened."</p>

<p>"It is well to be prepared for any emergency,
since no man can say exactly what may happen.
During the night two constables will go to the barn
on the marshes where you saw the burglars carry
some of the goods, although I do not think any
good is liable to result from the visit, for the men
have probably been frightened away by this time.
Enough may be found, however, to prove the truth
of your story, and that will be sufficient to give the
thick-headed authorities an inkling that their judgment
as to who the burglars are is not infallible."</p>

<p>"Have you seen Mr. Hazelton yet?"<span class="pagenum">[211]</span></p>

<p>"No; but I shall call on him before going home.
The best thing which could happen now for all concerned
would be the arrest of the man you call
Long Jim, and to that end both you and Dan must
keep a sharp lookout, for it is barely possible he
may be bold enough to come on the grounds again."</p>

<p>"But what could we do in case we did see him?"</p>

<p>"Follow him quietly until you meet a constable,
and then insist that he be arrested for swindling
you out of fifteen dollars. There is not sufficient
proof to connect him with the robbery here or at
the Run; but I will take care that he is held long
enough as a common swindler to enable us to sift
the other matter. Let me see, you said Dan was
with you at the time of the transaction in Waterville?"</p>

<p>"No; it was poor Sam, and now that he is dead
I'm the only one who saw Long Jim there. Do you
know if they have found Sam's body?"</p>

<p>"I think not; men have been dragging the creek
all day, and the probabilities now are that some
time will elapse before it can be recovered. I want
you to be very careful during the remainder of to-day
and to-night. Go to the tent where you sleep
before dark, and do not venture outside under any
provocation, no matter what message may be
brought."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Teddy asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Nothing particular; I am only taking precautions,<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
that is all. I shall be here to-morrow, and
will see you then."</p>

<p>The lawyer turned to go, and had just passed out
from behind the end of the booth when Teddy
seized his arm, pulling him back very suddenly.
"There's Long Jim now!" he whispered, excitedly.
"See! That man over there by the striking
machine!"</p>

<p>It was indeed the burglar whose partner had
warned him against visiting the fair, or even showing
himself in the vicinity during the daytime. It
could be plainly seen that he was decidedly under
the influence of liquor, and he swaggered to and
fro as if in his drunken brain was the idea that no
one would dare cause him trouble.</p>

<p>"Are you certain there is no mistake?" the lawyer
asked, as he watched the man.</p>

<p>"I'd be able to recognize him anywhere, no matter
how he was dressed, an' so would Dan, for Sam
an' me pointed him out two or three times."</p>

<p>"Then the hardest portion of our work is finished.
I shall have him arrested on the charge of swindling
you, and can arrange it without the formality
of first getting a warrant. It is now more necessary
than ever that you should remain where I can
find you readily at any hour of the day or night."</p>

<p>"Except when I go for supper, I'll be here or in
the tent," Teddy replied, and then there was no
further opportunity for conversation.<span class="pagenum">[213]</span></p>

<p>Long Jim had started leisurely, and on anything
rather than a straight course, toward the grand
stand, and Mr. Harvey followed so near that he
could have placed his hand on the burglar's
shoulder.</p>

<p>Teddy watched until the two were lost to view
amid the throng, and then said to himself, with a
sigh:</p>

<p>"I'll bet the lawyer can't find a constable, an'
that Long Jim gets clear somehow. But what I
don't understand is how he dares to come here."</p>

<p>He would have run down to tell Dan of the startling
news had it not been for Mr. Harvey's injunction
to remain in the places designated, and he was
so nervous that only with the greatest difficulty
could he wait upon an impatient customer.</p>

<p>An hour passed, and nothing had been heard
from either the lawyer or the burglar.</p>

<p>The visitors remained later on this day than
usual; but the tardy ones were departing, and it
was with a decided sense of relief that Teddy began
to pack up his stock for the night. Dan arrived
before the work was finished, and his excitement
was great when he learned of what had happened.</p>

<p>"Can't we go somewhere to find out if the man
was arrested?" he asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>"I promised to be on hand in case the lawyer
should want me."</p>

<p>"Then we'll get the stuff to the tent, go to supper,<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
an' afterward I'll snoop 'round to hear the
news."</p>

<p>All hands worked rapidly, and in ten minutes the
three boys were at the boarding-house, eating
as if each moment were of the utmost importance,
when they overheard a conversation between two
men at the next table which caused them no slight
degree of relief and pleasure:</p>

<p>"Who was that drunken fellow Constable Ford
lugged off this evening?" one of the men asked, and
the other replied:</p>

<p>"A man who swindled a boy over at Waterville
out of fifteen dollars."</p>

<p>"I didn't see any boy in the crowd."</p>

<p>"He wasn't there. Lawyer Harvey recognized
the fellow, and insisted on his arrest, sayin' that
the 'Squire already knew about the case."</p>

<p>"I thought at first it might be some one who had
been robbing the stores around here."</p>

<p>"Oh, the burglar has been caught already, an'
laid in jail since yesterday."</p>

<p>"But he was only arrested on suspicion."</p>

<p>"There'll be proof enough to convict him, I
reckon, an' if there isn't he ought to be sent to jail
for six months because of what he has done on the
grounds."</p>

<p>Then the conversation was changed to a subject
in which the boys had no interest, and Dan whispered
to Teddy:<span class="pagenum">[215]</span></p>

<p>"That settles Long Jim, an' now if your lawyer
is as smart as he appears to be it won't take long
to show that Hazelton didn't have anything to do
with the burglar tryin' to get me in jail," Teddy
replied, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Of course it will. Things are turning out all
right after all, an' if poor Sam hadn't been drowned
we'd have a reg'lar celebration to-night."</p>

<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>A THIRD ARREST.</i></p>

<p>When the boys returned to the museum tent
from supper they had a long and interesting
story to tell Mr. Sweet; but to their surprise, after
the recital was concluded, he said calmly:</p>

<p>"I knew all of that except about the burglar's
arrest."</p>

<p>"Why, how did you hear it?" Dan asked.</p>

<p>"The lawyer an' the merchant have been over
here twice since noon, pumpin' me about Hazelton,
an' tryin' to find out how you boys have behaved
yourselves."</p>

<p>"Why did they want to know anything about
us?" Teddy asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>"So's to make sure your stories were straight.
When men like them take hold of a thing they
don't want to run any chances of bein' fooled.
What has been done about Sam?"</p>

<p>Dan could best answer this question, and he replied:</p>

<p>"The body hasn't been found; but I heard the
manager of the Davis Boat Company's exhibit say<span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
that he should keep men at the work of draggin'
the creek till the work was finished. I can't get
through my head how he happened to capsize the
craft, for she didn't seem to be cranky."</p>

<p>"That is something none of us will ever know,"
Mr. Sweet replied, solemnly, and then, as if to
change the mournful subject, he asked: "How did
business pan out to-day, Teddy?"</p>

<p>"I'll count up. We must have come pretty near
to what you predicted; but we would have done a
great deal better if it hadn't been for the big row.
That made us lose at least an hour, to say nothin'
of havin' six canes broken just when we needed
every one in order to make a good show."</p>

<p>Then Teddy and Tim emptied the contents of
their pockets on a piece of canvas, and the other
occupants of the tent waited patiently for the result
to be announced.</p>

<p>"It's ninety-four dollars and forty-five cents," the
former said, after counting the money twice as if
doubtful of the first result. "That's a big sum of
money, but there's no chance of a mistake."</p>

<p>"You can figure that the row cost you six dollars,"
Mr. Sweet replied, puffing vigorously at his
pipe. "I haven't been 'tendin' out on fairs these
eight years without bein' able to name the amount
of such a business as yours."</p>

<p>"We'd have had twenty-five more but for that
row," Tim said, decidedly.<span class="pagenum">[218]</span></p>

<p>"You're wrong there, my boy," and the proprietor
of the museum wore an air of one who "knows
it all." "That is about as much as two boys can
take in, an' you don't want to kick, for I've seen
lots of fakirs come on to a fair ground with a better
cane-board than yours an' not get expenses. Be
thankful for what you've earned, an' hope that you
can pay expenses to-morrow, for there won't be any
too much money floatin' around after such a business
as we've had to-day."</p>

<p>"I'm more than satisfied," Teddy replied, as he
set aside the amount due Tim, and the latter appeared
to be more than contented with having
earned nine dollars and forty-four cents so easily.</p>

<p>"You can suck your thumbs from now out," the
barker said, philosophically, "for the backbone
of trade has been broken, an' the Peach Bottom
fair is already numbered with the things of the
past."</p>

<p>"Don't you think we'll do anything more?" Teddy
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, there'll be a little to pick up until to-morrow
night, but it won't amount to anything
near like what has already been done, although
it'll be clear profit."</p>

<p>"Since I am more than satisfied, there's no chance
of being disappointed," Teddy replied, and at that
moment the head of a stranger appeared between
the flaps of canvas.<span class="pagenum">[219]</span></p>

<p>"Is there a boy named Teddy here?" the newcomer
asked.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want of him?" and Mr. Sweet
sprang to his feet as if anticipating trouble.</p>

<p>"Nothing more than what Hazelton wanted me
to say," was the reply, as the stranger entered, evidently
thinking his search was at an end.</p>

<p>"And what is that?" the proprietor of the museum
asked, motioning Teddy to remain silent.</p>

<p>"There's no need of all this secrecy with me, for
I'm Hazelton's partner in everything except the
give-away game," the stranger said, with a laugh.
"It appears a man has been arrested by a party
whom this boy Teddy knows, and I'm to say that
he is to come to jail very early to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>Even now Mr. Sweet's suspicions were not allayed,
and he asked, cautiously:</p>

<p>"Could you tell me what he's wanted for?"</p>

<p>"Lawyer Harvey will be there, and is going to
talk with him where Hazelton can hear what is
said."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"Everything; and if you see the boy, can I depend
on your repeating the message?"</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances there can be no harm
in taking every precaution," the proprietor of the
museum replied, "and if your errand is finished,
I may as well say that this is the boy Teddy whom
Hazelton sent you to see."<span class="pagenum">[220]</span></p>

<p>"That's all right; there was no need of pointing
him out; but since you have done so, I simply want
to ask if he can spare the time to do as Hazelton
and the lawyer wish?"</p>

<p>"Of course I can," and now Teddy spoke for
himself. "Say that if nothing happens I'll be
there."</p>

<p>"Have you heard whether your uncle has succeeded
in getting a warrant?" the stranger asked.</p>

<p>"No; but Mr. Harvey seemed to think he might
be able to do so, and I don't want to make any
promises that can't be carried out."</p>

<p>"Then I'll count on your being there, but since
leaving the jail I've heard enough to warrant my
advising you to remain under cover to-night."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Those fellows who started the fight when you
got away with the money are swearing vengeance.
I don't think it's likely they'll attack the tent, for,
owing to the representations made by the lawyer,
there'll be a big force of constables on duty to-night;
but if you should venture outside the grounds
it might be impossible to keep any engagement in
the future."</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinkin' of leaving here," Teddy replied;
but the mere fact that he ought not do so
made him feel very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"I couldn't be in any worse fix if I had committed
some big crime," he said, bitterly, "and it is tough<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
to feel like a criminal when a fellow is only trying
to earn honest money."</p>

<p>"It isn't the rule that honest people fare the best,"
the stranger replied, with a laugh; "but I hope
you'll come out on the top of the heap. At all
events, my business here is finished and I'll go."</p>

<p>The folds of canvas dropped behind him, and Mr.
Sweet said, musingly:</p>

<p>"It beats all how you boys have succeeded in
getting yourselves mixed up in this affair. If I
didn't know all the circumstances I'd say there
must be some fire where there is so much smoke."</p>

<p>"The smoke isn't of our makin', an' Teddy's uncle
can be blamed for the most of it," Dan said,
angrily. "I only wish he was here to know my
opinion of him."</p>

<p>"Are you talkin' about me?" Uncle Nathan asked,
as he pushed aside the canvas and entered without
so much as asking permission.</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I was doing," Dan replied,
without any show of fear, "an' if you've been
sneakin' 'round to listen, there's no need of my
tellin' over ag'in jest what I think of a man who
tries to frighten an honest boy into givin' up half
of what he has made."</p>

<p>"An honest boy?" the old man repeated, with a
sneer, and Teddy whispered to his friend:</p>

<p>"Don't say anything to make him angry, for I'll
only get the worst of it."<span class="pagenum">[222]</span></p>

<p>"Of course you will," Uncle Nathan replied,
having overheard the words. "When an ungrateful
wretch like you conspires to rob the hand that
has fed him he must expect to get the worst of it."</p>

<p>"I never took from you the value of a cent,"
Teddy said, stoutly, and Dan cried as he sprang to
his feet:</p>

<p>"If there has been any attempt at robbery, you're
the guilty one, for you've tried to steal half the
money he made by threatening to have him
arrested if he didn't divide his profits."</p>

<p>"That was only a business proposition," the old
man replied, not in the least abashed, "and he
has aided others in stealing from me."</p>

<p>"What do you want here?" Mr. Sweet cried,
angrily. "This is my tent; I have paid for the
privilege of putting it upon these grounds, and have
the right to prevent such old hypocrites as you
from entering without paying an admission."</p>

<p>"Look out that you do not come within reach of
the law," Uncle Nathan replied, threateningly,
stepping back quickly, as if expecting an attack.
"I am here armed with the right to take this boy,
and shall exercise it despite all that may be said.
Come in, Mr. Officer."</p>

<p>In response to this call a constable entered, and
Teddy's heart sank within him, for he understood
that the long-deferred arrest was about to be made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[223]</span></p><p>"There is your prisoner," the old man said, vindictively,
as he pointed to the boy, "and the sooner
you take him to jail where he belongs the sooner
we shall be rid of a viper."</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">As the constable approached him, Teddy said, &quot;I demand to be first taken to Deacon Jones!&quot;</p>

<p>Teddy's grief and fear were so great that he could
not speak, and even Dan appeared to have been
made dumb by this show of authority; but Mr.
Sweet was somewhat accustomed to such scenes,
and he demanded:</p>

<p>"Show me the warrant. I do not propose to let
any one be taken out of my tent by such an old
reprobate as that until I am satisfied it is done under
the sanction of the law."</p>

<p>"Convince yourself," Uncle Nathan replied, as
the constable held out a folded document. "That
will show under what authority we act."</p>

<p>Sweet read it carefully, and handed it to the
officer as he said to the old man:</p>

<p>"This shows that the constable has the right to
take Teddy to prison; but as certain as there will
be a sun in the sky to-morrow so certain will I aid
him in making you suffer for doing this thing.
You know he had nothing to do with the burglary
committed at your store, and have only had this
issued in the hope of defrauding him of what he
has earned honestly."</p>

<p>"Talk is cheap," Uncle Nathan said, impatiently.
"Officer, take your prisoner away unless you count
on stayin' here all night."</p>

<p>The short parley between the proprietor of the<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
museum and the accuser gave Teddy time to think
of what the lawyer had said, and he added, as the
constable approached him:</p>

<p>"I demand to be first carried to Deacon Jones'."</p>

<p>"Now what kind of a bee have you got in your
bonnet?" the old man cried, displaying both surprise
and fear. "I say you are to go to jail, an'
that settles it."</p>

<p>"If he wants to see the deacon I'm bound to take
him there," the constable said.</p>

<p>"Who's been makin' sich foolish talk to you?"
Uncle Nathan screamed.</p>

<p>"Lawyer Harvey told me what the law was, an' I
don't intend to get into any fuss by deprivin' a
prisoner of his rights," was the stolid reply.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<p class="h3">ON BAIL.</p>

<p>When Uncle Nathan learned that the celebrated
lawyer had made preparations for this
move on his part he was literally beside himself
with rage, and vowed that the warrant should be
served and the prisoner taken to jail immediately,
or he would see to it that the constable was deprived
of his commission without delay.</p>

<p>"I've served the warrant," the man said, quietly,
"an' now the prisoner is in my custody. You have
no more to say what shall be done with him than
that goat, so shut your mouth."</p>

<p>"I'll shut yours so close it won't be opened again
for a month!" the old man screamed. "Do as I
tell you, or take the consequences."</p>

<p>"And I'm goin' to give you the same advice,"
Mr. Sweet cried, as he advanced toward Uncle
Nathan threateningly. "Now the boy has been
arrested, you are an intruder here, an' I'll give you
thirty seconds in which to get out; after that we'll
make an example of such a reprobate."</p>

<p>"I'll go when I get ready, an' not a minute before.<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
Lay a hand on me an' I'll have a warrant for
you."</p>

<p>"If you can get it, well and good. I now order
you out for the last time. In thirty seconds I'll
guarantee you won't be in condition to walk."</p>

<p>While their employer had been speaking the
barker and the clown silently ranged themselves
by his side, ready for any commands which might
be given, and the infuriated old man had sufficient
sense left to let him understand it would be unsafe
to linger.</p>

<p>"I'll serve you out before this thing is ended," he
cried, shaking his fist in impotent rage as he went
toward the flap, and Dan, who could control himself
no longer, replied:</p>

<p>"You'd better begin on me, for I'm goin' to tell
this thing to everybody who comes to the fair to-morrow,
an' from what I've heard it wouldn't take
much coaxin' to get the band from the Run up here,
so's I could sing it. You're havin' a good time now;
but there'll be a different side to the matter to-morrow."</p>

<p>Mr. Sweet had followed Uncle Nathan so closely,
literally turning him out, that he could not reply
while inside the canvas; but once in the open air,
he made threats that would have frightened any
one who did not know the motive by which they
had been inspired.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the constable appeared disposed to<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
take matters in the most comfortable manner. He
asked Teddy why he wished to see Deacon Jones,
and the boy said:</p>

<p>"I don't know; but Mr. Harvey told me that if
anything happened to-night I was to see the deacon."</p>

<p>"Then we'll go there. Are you ready?"</p>

<p>Teddy thought of his money, and, fearing lest
it might be taken from him, asked if he could hand
something to Mr. Sweet.</p>

<p>"I think not," was the undecided reply. "The
deacon will know, an' whatever he says I'll stand by."</p>

<p>"Don't bother about anything just now," the
proprietor of the museum said. "We'll all go with
you, an' there'll be plenty of time to make necessary
arrangements before you're taken to jail."</p>

<p>Although the lawyer had assured him he could
be involved in no serious trouble, the mere fact
that he was under arrest sufficed to make Teddy
wretched, and like one under sentence of death, he
prepared to accompany the constable.</p>

<p>Dan and Tim intended to join the party, as was
shown by their remaining very close to the prisoner,
and only the barker and the clown were left
to care for the tent.</p>

<p>Uncle Nathan was met on the outside, and he
immediately began to insist that the boy be taken
to jail at once; but the officer paid no attention to
his ravings.<span class="pagenum">[228]</span></p>

<p>"If you don't hold your tongue I'll knock the
whole top of your head off," Mr. Sweet whispered,
brandishing his fists in the most threatening manner,
and the old man cried, excitedly:</p>

<p>"Mr. Officer, I call upon you to bear witness that
this man is threatening my life, and insist that you
protect me from insult."</p>

<p>"I've nothing to do with you," the constable
replied, with a laugh. "The warrant has been
served, an' all you've got to do is hold your horses
till the case is called up in court."</p>

<p>"Wait till I get home once more, an' then we'll
see that he's got a good deal to do with the case,"
Tim cried. "I'll spend every minute from then for
a week tellin' the folks that he only did this to
make Teddy give up half of what he made, an' it'll
be a pretty poor kind of a chump who'll do any
more tradin' at his store."</p>

<p>Uncle Nathan stepped toward the boy who had
spoken so boldly as if he would inflict the direst
punishment then and there; but he probably realized
that this would prejudice his case, and contented
himself by saying:</p>

<p>"We'll see whether the people at the Run will
believe a couple of boys who have been in league
with burglars, for you mustn't forget, Tim Jones,
that I have proof you helped Teddy to carry away
the burglar's money."</p>

<p>"If it'll do you any good I'll own up to the fact<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
now," the boy replied. "It can't be so bad to do
that as it is to arrest your own nephew because he
won't give you half his money."</p>

<p>"Don't say anything more," Teddy whispered to
his friend. "It's only makin' matters worse, an'
he's got the upper hand of us all jest now."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether he has or not," the valiant
Tim replied; "but at the same time it'll do him a
world of good to let him hear the truth."</p>

<p>At this point Uncle Nathan appeared to understand
that he was not coming out victor in this
battle of tongues, and he wisely held his peace,
saying not another word until the little party
arrived at the home of Deacon Jones.</p>

<p>The manager of the fair was resting after a
particularly hard day's work. More than one of
the citizens of Peach Bottom had openly said he
was responsible for the riot by allowing liquor to
be sold on the grounds, and his greeting of the visitors
was not calculated to assure the frightened
Teddy.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want?" he cried, roughly, as
they entered his library. "If it's anything concerning
the fair I won't open my mouth. A man
can't be driven to death with work and then disturbed
at all hours of the night, simply to give the
fools in this town a chance to make trouble."</p>

<p>"All I know about it is that I arrested this boy,
and he insisted on being brought to you, saying<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
it was Lawyer Harvey's advice," the constable
began, and the angry deacon immediately began
to appear interested.</p>

<p>"Is this your nephew, Nathan?" he asked of the
old man, who now had a smirk of confidence on
his face.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry he is, deacon, an' after I set him up
in business he goes ag'in me by givin' information
to burglars, who rob me."</p>

<p>"And you have had him arrested?"</p>

<p>"I felt obliged to in the interest of society."</p>

<p>"That's a lie," Mr. Sweet interrupted, angrily.
"He tried to make the boy pay him half he earned
on the fair grounds, and has done this thing only
because Teddy refused."</p>

<p>"We won't go into the details of the case, because
I am not a magistrate," the deacon replied, with a
majestic wave of the hand. "Mr. Officer, tell the
'Squire that I am prepared to go bail to any
amount, and ask if the business can't be conducted
here, for I'm too tired to go out of doors unless it is
absolutely necessary."</p>

<p>"What?" the old man screamed. "Will you
answer for that little villain's appearance at court?"</p>

<p>"That's what I said, Nathan. This affair is none
of my business other than I have stated; but I
must say you are goin' a leetle too far, not only in
my opinion, but in that of others, an' it may prove
a costly job for somebody before it's finished."<span class="pagenum">[231]</span></p>

<p>The old man was literally speechless.</p>

<p>He could not understand why the deacon should
have turned against him so suddenly, and the last
words made him decidedly uneasy.</p>

<p>He was not to be silenced without a struggle,
however. After the first surprise had died away
he said, with a comical assumption of dignity:</p>

<p>"I will see whether I'm to be browbeaten in
this manner. The 'Squire does not dare to release
the boy on bail, and I shall tell him so."</p>

<p>With these words he left the house hurriedly,
and the constable said to the deacon:</p>

<p>"If you will write a line to the 'Squire, saying
that you're ready to go bail, I do not think there
will be any necessity of troubling you again to-night."</p>

<p>This suggestion was immediately acted upon,
and the weary manager of the fair penned the following
words:</p>

<blockquote><p>I am ready to enter security to any amount for
the appearance at court of Edward Hargreaves,
and if you should not consider my bond sufficient,
I am empowered to say that John Reaves, of Waterville,
will add his name, therefore there can be no
good reason for committing him to jail, since we
are both responsible for the prisoner until the bond
can be executed.</p>

<p class="author smcap">A. Jones</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having received this the constable departed with
the prisoner and his friends, and once on the outside
he said, confidently:<span class="pagenum">[232]</span></p>

<p>"The matter is settled, no matter how much old
Nathan may rave. Both Mr. Reaves an' the deacon
have got the 'Squire by the nose, and he must
dance to their fiddlin'."</p>

<p>That this assertion was correct Teddy realized a
few moments later when he was ushered into the
'Squire's dining-room, and the latter, without paying
the slightest attention to the prisoner, said to
the officer:</p>

<p>"I have just heard that you served the warrant I
issued, and then took the boy to Deacon Jones'
house. Is that correct?"</p>

<p>"Straight as a string, 'Squire. Lawyer Harvey
told him if anything happened to go there, an' I
thought he had a right to look up bail before being
lugged off to jail. Here's what the deacon's got to
say about it."</p>

<p>The 'Squire took the paper which the officer held
out, and after reading it, said benignly:</p>

<p>"You were quite correct in doing what you did,
Mr. Constable. This is quite sufficient guarantee
that he will be produced when wanted, and you
may let him go. Give me the papers, and I will
indorse them."</p>

<p>After this formality had been gone through with
the constable said to Mr. Sweet:</p>

<p>"That settles the matter so far as Teddy is concerned,
and with such men as the deacon, Mr.
Reaves, and Lawyer Harvey to back him, I don't<span class="pagenum">[233]</span>
believe old Nathan will make any too much out of
this job."</p>

<p>"You are free to go where you please," the
'Squire added, and the young fakir with his friends
left the house, wondering very much at the amount
of influence which, unsolicited, had been exerted
in Teddy's behalf.</p>

<p>As for the boy himself, he was far from feeling
comfortable in mind. Unless the burglary could be
brought home to Long Jim it did not seem possible
that Hazelton could be set free, and this last was
absolutely necessary in order to establish his own
innocence.</p>

<p>It was a great consolation for him to be with such
good friends, however, and each in turn tried to
cheer him, but without success until Mr. Sweet
said:</p>

<p>"There's no question of your getting out of the
scrape with flying colors, and to celebrate I'm goin'
to give a regular dinner party to every decent
fakir on the grounds. Come over, boys, an' help
me get ready. Business has been so good to-day
that I can afford to indulge in a little extravagance."</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>THE FAKIRS' PARTY.</i></p>

<p>The idea of a party in the museum tent, where
there would be no guests save fakirs, struck
Teddy as being very comical, and he laughed heartily
despite the fact that he was still virtually a prisoner
in the meshes of the law; but at the same time
he did not think Mr. Sweet was really in earnest
when he made the proposition.</p>

<p>It was not many moments, however, before he
understood that the party was to be given in the
most elaborate manner possible.</p>

<p>On arriving at the tent Mr. Sweet sent the
bouncer out with invitations to such of the fakirs as
remained on the grounds all night, or lived in the
immediate vicinity, and at the same time the clown
started for the town in order to purchase refreshments.</p>

<p>"Now, you boys are to take right hold an' help
the best you know how," the proprietor of the
museum said as he pulled off his coat and vest
preparatory to making ready for the feast. "If
them as comes want to sit down it must be on the
ground, owing to the lack of chairs, therefore it
<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>don't make much difference if the table is a trifle
high."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus249.jpg" width="600" height="525" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">&quot;We have only one knife,&quot; said Mr. Sweet, to the amusement of the boys, &quot;and it must serve for all hands.&quot;</p>

<p>To the surprise of the boys he proceeded to convert
the wagon into a "festal board" by first pulling
it into the center of the tent, and then removing
the sides. Over the floor of this newspapers were
spread, and two plates, three forks, one knife, and
four tin dippers were placed on the impromptu
cloth.</p>

<p>"The provisions will be cut ready for eating,"
Mr. Sweet explained, "so one knife must serve for
all hands, and it won't hurt any of the crowd if
they're obliged to take turns using the dippers."</p>

<p>The clown returned before the guests began to
assemble. He brought cold sausage, sliced ham,
cold fried potatoes, sweet crackers, cake, pie, and
a quantity of lemons and sugar.</p>

<p>Contrary to his expectations, Mr. Sweet did not
think this assortment sufficient for the kind of a
dinner he proposed to give, and the messenger was
forced to return in search of cheese, pickled pig's
feet, sardines, and milk for the coffee.</p>

<p>Matters were in a decided state of confusion
when the first of the guests arrived. Mr. Sweet,
not troubled by the absence of dishes, had placed
the various articles on the wagon-table in the
brown paper coverings as they had been received,
and it was upon his skill as a maker of coffee that
he based his reputation as a host.<span class="pagenum">[236]</span></p>

<p>Therefore everything was neglected for this one
important thing, and the proprietor was standing
over the oil stove with a look of grave responsibility
on his face when the owner of the envelope
game and his assistant arrived.</p>

<p>"The boys will take care of you," he said, hurriedly,
bending over the huge pot to inhale the
odor, in order to know exactly how the berries
were adapting themselves to the infusion, and,
much to his surprise, Teddy found himself the one
especial feature of the party.</p>

<p>All on the ground had evidently heard of his
arrest, for each new arrival asked concerning the
events of the evening, and, what was more to the
purpose, so far as he was concerned, all seemed to
think his troubles were only temporary.</p>

<p>"You'll come out of it all right," the manager of
the largest sandwich booth said, confidently, as he
entered with his hat on one side of his head and a
cigar held in his mouth at an angle of forty-five
degrees. "I heard of your uncle last year, when he
tried to make trouble for a friend of mine in the
spittoon game, an' you can bet your bottom dollar
that the people here are not going to take much
stock in what he says."</p>

<p>"It seems they did, so far as to issue a warrant
for my arrest," Teddy replied, with a mirthless
smile.</p>

<p>"But that won't amount to anything. I hear you<span class="pagenum">[237]</span>
have got John Reaves as a friend, an' he comes
pretty near runnin' things to suit himself in Peach
Bottom. He helped my friend out of the scrape
your uncle put him into, an' folks say there's no
love lost between him an' Nathan Hargreaves."</p>

<p>"I want to get out of my trouble simply on the
ground that I am not guilty," Teddy replied. "If
I am charged with aiding burglars, there's precious
little consolation in being set free simply because
people do not like the man who made the charge."</p>

<p>"Nobody believes you guilty, and for the matter
of that I'm certain Hazelton had nothing to do
with the job. His game ain't exactly square; but
he don't go around breaking into stores."</p>

<p>Teddy was on the point of telling that Long Jim
had been arrested because of the burglaries committed;
but he remembered in time that this fact
was as yet a secret, and remained silent.</p>

<p>The man who leased the only "Great African
Dodger" was the next to arrive, and he also seemed
to think it necessary to condole with the young
fakir in his troubles, as did the remainder of the
guests, and by the time all were assembled Teddy
began to think his experience was only such as
every other person in the tent had undergone at
some time in his career.</p>

<p>"You see this is the way the matter stands,"
the whip man said, confidentially, while Mr. Sweet
was bending all his energies to mixing the lemonade.<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>
"People think fakirs are the worst class of
men in the world, whereas, if the matter was sifted
right down, they'd find the class as a whole was
honest because they couldn't afford to be otherwise.
I'm not talking now about those who run
strong games, like Hazelton; but ourselves who
do a legitimate business. You've got canes an'
knives to sell, while I deal in whips; now all we
want is a fair show to dispose of our goods, an'
we know everything must be done on the square,
or there's bound to be trouble sooner or later, consequently
we keep straight, an' take all the abuse
which those who have come to swindle the folks
deserve. Why, what, I ask you, would the managers
of these fairs do if they couldn't get us to
come up with our money for privileges? They
couldn't pay expenses, an' that's the whole amount
of the story. They run after us, an' yet when we
come there's the same old howl about swindlers."</p>

<p>The man talked until he was literally forced to
stop for lack of breath, and Teddy had not so much
as spoken; but proved a good listener, which was
all his condoler appeared to expect of him.</p>

<p>When the clown returned with the last installment
of eatables there was nothing to prevent the
assembled crowd from partaking of Mr. Sweet's
hospitality. The coffee was done to a turn; the
lemonade was neither too sour nor too sweet, and<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
the proprietor of the museum summoned his guests
to the feast by saying:</p>

<p>"Now turn to an' fill yourselves up. It ain't often
I do this sort of thing; but somehow or other I've
got a reg'lar admiration for our cane-board fakir,
an' after comin' out as he has to-night it seems
only right we should kinder spread ourselves.
There's no liquor in the tent, which is as it should
be, for I'm a temperance man, an' them as wants
it can make hogs of themselves somewhere else.
Take hold hearty, an' remember that this layout is
in honor of them as did a good turn to the whole
gang by savin' the lives of the women what would
likely have drowned if there hadn't been any fakirs
in the country."</p>

<p>This was an unusually long speech for the proprietor
of the museum, and when it was ended he
set an example to his guests by attacking the eatables
as if he had not indulged in a square meal
since the fair was opened.</p>

<p>Each person present imitated him, and Tim whispered
to Teddy, when his mouth was so full of cake
that it was only with the greatest difficulty his
words could be understood:</p>

<p>"This is what I call a great snap, an' when I've
been fakin' at the fairs long enough to get some
money ahead I'll give fellers like us a good chance
to fill up, the same as Mr. Sweet has done."</p>

<p>Dan was equally enthusiastic. In all his experience,<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
which extended over two years at the very
least, he declared that he had never seen so much
done for a boy, and concluded by saying:</p>

<p>"There's no question, Teddy, but that you're a
big gun here, an' I'll advise you to keep right on in
this business."</p>

<p>"I've had enough of it," was the reply. "Such
times as these are very nice; but think of what
may happen when I'm brought up for trial. Who
knows but Uncle Nathan can succeed in makin'
folks think I'm guilty of helpin' the burglars, an'
then what'll be the consequences?"</p>

<p>"I know he can't do anything of the kind, an'
that's enough," was the confident reply; but yet it
failed to satisfy the boy who had been bound over
to appear at court.</p>

<p>The entire party appeared to be having the
jolliest kind of a jolly time; but ever before Teddy's
mental vision came the picture of himself in
prison, and even the fact that Long Jim had been
arrested failed to render him confident as to the
final result.</p>

<p>Again and again was he called upon to reply as
one after another wished him good luck in the case,
and the amount of lemonade which was consumed
on each occasion caused the clown to make a third
visit to the town in order to purchase the wherewithal
to satisfy the demands of the guests.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight when the last of the<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
revelers departed and the boys were called upon to
help set the interior of the tent to rights.</p>

<p>"It hasn't been sich a bad time after all," Mr.
Sweet said, musingly, as Teddy and Dan aided him
in wheeling the wagon into place. "A man can
remember an evening like this with pleasure, when
liquor has been kept out of the bill of fare, an' who
shall say that we're not better off than if our legs
were so tangled as to make walking an impossibility?"</p>

<p>The barker's red nose was slightly elevated,
much as if its owner could explain why spirits
were superior to lemon-juice and water; but Mr.
Sweet's question remained unanswered, and the
party set about making the final preparations for
the night.</p>

<p>"Poor Sam ain't here to be troubled by the goat,
so we can set him loose," the proprietor of the
museum said as he unfastened the rope from the
neck of his pet.</p>

<p>"He'll have a great time pickin' up odds an' ends
between now an' daylight, an' then feel so lazy
that it'll be hard work to make him do his tricks."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose Uncle Nathan will be around in
the morning?" Teddy asked as he lay down by
the side of Dan and Tim.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it; he got sich a dose to-night that
I don't count on seem' him ag'in till this fair is
ended, an' then I'm going to take a trip over to the<span class="pagenum">[242]</span>
Run for the express purpose of givin' him a piece
of my mind."</p>

<p>"But suppose he should come, what shall I say?"</p>

<p>"Pay no attention to the old fool, an' above all,
don't let him trap you into talking. Mr. Harvey
will be here to-morrow, an' he can post you better
than ever I could."</p>

<p>"Don't fuss about the thing at all," Dan replied,
philosophically. "There's plenty here who know
you hadn't anything to do with the burglaries, an'
he won't have as much as a friend by the time the
trial is ended."</p>

<p>"Dan comes pretty nigh being right," Mr. Sweet
added, "an' now I want all hands to go to sleep, for
there's one more day of this fair, an' we need to be
somewhere near fresh, because to-morrow the dollars
won't tumble without a good deal of coaxing.
Good-night."</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>IN HIDING.</i></p>

<p>That the incidents may be related as nearly as
possible in the order of their occurrence it is
time to return to the spot where the burglars are in
hiding.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that we last saw Sam after
Phil had fallen asleep, and he was feigning unconsciousness
lest Long Jim, having nothing else to
do, should take it into his ugly head to administer
the promised flogging.</p>

<p>Although Sam's eyes were apparently closed, he
took good care to keep strict watch on the burglar;
but for what seemed a very long time he saw
nothing to cause any apprehensions, and was just
on the point of going to sleep in reality when Jim
asked, as he gave the boy a vicious kick on the
side:</p>

<p>"Where's the grub?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. You put it away after finishing
your dinner."</p>

<p>"Oh, I remember now," and the burglar, still
considerably more than half stupefied by the
amount of liquor he had drunk, arose to his feet so<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
unsteadily that it seemed as if only the lightest
touch would be necessary to send him headlong.</p>

<p>After a short search the man found that which he
wanted, and proceeded to make a hearty meal, regardless
of the hungry glances which the boy
bestowed upon him.</p>

<p>"Don't think I'm goin' to give you any," he said,
with a leer, as he concluded the repast, "You're
lucky to be alive, an' that's enough for sich a
duffer. I'll put this stuff back, an' you'll have
every bone in your body broken if you so much as
smell of it."</p>

<p>Sam made no reply. He had already learned
that there are very many times when silence is indeed
"golden."</p>

<p>"I've made up my mind to see what can be done
at the fair," Jim said, as he lighted his pipe with
great deliberation. "Phil thinks he's the only
smart man in the world, an' it's time to show him
what a mistake he's been makin' all his life. Why
don't you say something?" he cried, angrily, as
Sam continued silent.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you want me to say. If
you're goin' that settles it; I sha'n't be any better
off."</p>

<p>"You can stake your life on that, for while I'm a
gentleman an' behave myself as such, Phil is a
reg'lar brute, an' will make things mighty uncomfortable
for a sneak like you."<span class="pagenum">[245]</span></p>

<p>Sam thought, but was very careful not to say,
that it was hardly possible for a boy to have a
worse master than the alleged gentleman in front
of him, and the burglar continued, as he arose to
his feet:</p>

<p>"I want to leave without wakin' Phil, but you
must do it as soon as I push off from the shore, for
we don't intend to give you a chance of slipping
away. I shall watch mighty close, an' if he isn't
on his feet before I'm a dozen yards out into the
creek you'll get a reminder from this," and the
man ostentatiously displayed a revolver.</p>

<p>"I don't count on runnin' off," Sam, replied,
thoroughly frightened by the threat. "I can stay
here till you get ready to let me go, because I've
got to, an' I'm not sich a fool as to git into any
worse scrape."</p>

<p>"Now you're talkin' somethin' like sense, an' if
you keep on in this way I'll see to it that you don't
have any harder time than a detective oughter
expect; Phil will be on his ear when he knows I've
gone, an' you must tell me all he says. Remember
that if he isn't on his feet before I've got beyond
range, I'll use your head for a target."</p>

<p>With this threat the burglar staggered out of the
thicket, and Sam began to speculate as to whether
he should make one supreme effort to escape before
his other captor awakened.</p>

<p>A second glance at the weapon decided him in the<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
negative, however, and he meekly stepped to the
edge of the woods in order to obey the instructions
given.</p>

<p>Despite Jim's apparent intoxication he watched
the boy closely, still holding the revolver ready
for use, and after pushing the boat into the stream
he cried:</p>

<p>"Now go ahead, an' let me see him in about two
minutes, or I'll fill you full of bullets."</p>

<p>If Sam had been a brave boy he would have made
a dash for liberty at this moment; but he was in
nearly every sense of the word a coward, and
obeyed the order literally.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" Phil asked, angrily, as the boy
shook him vigorously.</p>

<p>"Jim told me to make you get up, or he'd shoot,"
Sam replied, meekly.</p>

<p>"Make me get up? What time is it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; but it doesn't seem to be more
than three o'clock."</p>

<p>"Where's Jim?"</p>

<p>"Jest startin' for the fair grounds, an' if you
don't show yourself pretty soon he's sure to shoot
me."</p>

<p>"There wouldn't be any particular harm in that,
for you deserve it; but it can't be possible the fool
is goin' to show himself in daylight when more than
one is lookin' for him."</p>

<p>"That's what he said," and Sam, fearing lest the<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
half-drunken burglar would begin his pistol practice,
seated himself behind the largest tree that
might protect him from the bullets.</p>

<p>Now that Phil was awake, he did not lose any
further time in talking, but ran out to where he
could command a view of the creek, and once more
Sam had an opportunity for escape which he did
not dare to embrace.</p>

<p>"Come back here, an' don't make a fool of yourself,"
Jim's partner cried, angrily, as he saw the
man pulling leisurely from the bank.</p>

<p>"What's crawlin' on you? Don't I know my business?"</p>

<p>"Not if you count on goin' up there before dark."</p>

<p>"That's jest what I intend to do, so don't screech
so much."</p>

<p>"Come back, I tell you, or it'll be all up for both
of us!"</p>

<p>"I've been in this business long enough to know
it," was the reply, as Jim continued to row, increasing
each instant the distance between himself and
the shore.</p>

<p>"Now, don't spoil a good thing," Phil said, pleadingly,
and, understanding that this conversation
might be continued for a short time, Sam plucked
up sufficient courage to make an attack upon the
provisions.</p>

<p>He took from the general store a large piece of
cheese, some crackers and as much meat as he believed<span class="pagenum">[248]</span>
would suffice to make a hearty meal, after
which he hid the lot near the tree behind which he
was hiding.</p>

<p>Then he crept back to his former position, and
listened to the conversation between his captors.</p>

<p>Phil alternately coaxed and threatened his partner;
but all to no purpose, as could be told by the
tones of the latter's voice while he pulled up stream,
and the baffled burglar returned to the camping
place absolutely furious with rage.</p>

<p>"This comes of my bein' so foolish as to bring
that fool liquor," he said half to himself. "It's
mighty lucky he didn't know I had more than one
bottle."</p>

<p>Then he took from one of his pockets a second
flask, refreshing himself with a portion of the contents
before asking:</p>

<p>"What did he say to you?"</p>

<p>"Nothin' except that he was goin' up to the fair,"
Sam replied, timidly.</p>

<p>"But what made him tell you to waken me?"</p>

<p>"I s'pose that was so I couldn't have a chance to
run away."</p>

<p>"What else did he say?"</p>

<p>"That I was to tell him jest how you took his
leavin'."</p>

<p>"Well, if he's lucky enough to get back, tell him
I said he was the biggest fool that ever walked on
two legs. Them chums of your'n are sure to spot<span class="pagenum">[249]</span>
him, an' it's ten to one he's pinched before sunset."</p>

<p>Sam did not understand what the man meant by
the term "pinched," but under the circumstances
he hardly thought it safe to inquire, and the angry
burglar continued:</p>

<p>"We'll make ready to get out of this if he isn't
back by daylight, an' while there's nothin' else to
do you'd better put that stuff under ground, for
there's no knowin' now when we'll be able to take
it away."</p>

<p>The spade was near at hand ready for use, and
while Phil alternately smoked and drank from the
bottle, Sam set about burying the plunder.</p>

<p>This man was quite as hard a taskmaster as the
one who had just departed, and the boy was forced
to work as he had probably never done before, until
sufficient of an excavation had been made to conceal
the goods.</p>

<p>Under the direction of the burglar Sam covered
the different packages with earth; did his best to
hide all traces of his work, and when it was so dark
that he could no longer see to move about was allowed
to rest.</p>

<p>During this time Phil had been drinking and
smoking, with the result that he could hardly speak
plainly when the task was accomplished, and so intoxicated
did he appear to be that Sam thought it
safe to eat the food he had concealed.</p>

<p>"Keep on talkin' so's I'll know where you are, or<span class="pagenum">[250]</span>
on goes the ropes an' gag again," Phil cried, and
the boy obeyed, repeating over and over the same
words in order to satisfy his suspicious captor.</p>

<p>After eating a hearty meal, Sam succeeded in
mustering sufficient courage to admit of his thinking
about attempting to escape.</p>

<p>From the manner in which the burglar spoke he
knew it could not be very much longer before the
man would be so completely under the influence of
liquor as to render him helpless, and he said to himself:</p>

<p>"If I could get the rope around his hands an' legs
I'd soon be out of this place."</p>

<p>"What's that you are saying?" Phil cried, angrily.</p>

<p>"Nothin'; I was only doin' as you told me,
talkin' so's you'd know where I was."</p>

<p>"I'll save all that trouble," and the man lurched
to his feet as he picked up the rope.</p>

<p>"Please don't tie me ag'in," Sam pleaded. "I
won't try to git away."</p>

<p>"I'll go bail that you don't after I'm through with
you. Put out your hands."</p>

<p>Phil was yet capable of mischief, even though his
brain was clouded, and Sam did not dare to disobey.</p>

<p>He suffered himself to be tied without making
any remonstrance, and as the burglar staggered to
his former resting place, the boy tested the bonds.<span class="pagenum">[251]</span></p>

<p>Previously he had been lashed in such a manner
that it was impossible to move hand or foot, but
now he soon realized that he could do both, and the
happy thought came that he might free himself
with but little difficulty if a favorable opportunity
for escape should present itself.</p>

<p>"Now you're fixed," Phil said, half to himself,
"an' I may as well take things comfortable till
we're certain that that fool of a Jim is settled."</p>

<p>"Are you goin' to leave here to-night?" Sam
asked, more for the purpose of learning how far the
man was on the road to intoxication than for information.</p>

<p>"If he ain't here by twelve o'clock we'll know
the jig is up, an' skip so's to be out of the way before
any one can come sneakin' around for the
stuff."</p>

<p>"Then if Jim isn't back by that time, an' he
keeps on drinkin', I'll take all the chances," Sam
said to himself, and from that instant he strained
every nerve to learn how nearly the burglar had
succeeded in making a worse brute of himself than
nature intended.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>A FAILURE.</i></p>

<p>Tired though Teddy was, a long time elapsed
after the conclusion of the fakirs' feast before
he could close his eyes in slumber.</p>

<p>Now that the excitement of the party had died
away, the fact that he was a prisoner, suffered to
remain outside the prison only because men of
wealth were willing to guarantee he would respond
to the call of the court, came into his mind even
more vividly than at the time of the arrest, and despite
all the words of cheer which had been spoken
he really began to believe Uncle Nathan could show
plausible proof of his guilt.</p>

<p>Under almost any other circumstances he would
have speculated upon what should be done with the
large amount of money he had already earned, and
rejoiced at the thought that he could supply his
mother with what she might need for the present,
at all events.</p>

<p>The profits of the cane and knife boards were
hardly thought of on this night while the one painful<span class="pagenum">[253]</span>
fact stood before him so prominently and menacingly.</p>

<p>His companions had been asleep many hours before
slumber visited his eyelids, and so heavy was
his heart even while in dreamland that he awoke
with the first dawn of day, and aroused the
others to the last day's work they would be called
upon to do at the Peach Bottom fair during the
present season.</p>

<p>"Why is it that you have turned out so early?"
Mr. Sweet asked, in a sleepy tone, rising to his feet
as the only effectual method of driving the drowsiness
from his eyelids.</p>

<p>"I sha'n't feel much like sleeping till I know how
the case is coming out," Teddy replied, sadly.</p>

<p>"There is no need to worry with such friends as
you have got. Put it right out of your mind until
business closes to-night, for there's a big pile of
work to be done if you expect to make much
money."</p>

<p>"I wish I could," Teddy said, with a long-drawn
sigh as he aroused Tim and Dan.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the three boys were eating
what it was believed would be their last meal in
the very unsatisfactory boarding-house, and
Teddy's place of business was the first opened on
that morning.</p>

<p>There were no more early visitors; but the fakirs
who had been present at the feast on the evening<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
previous gathered around, all appearing very eager
to spend money, and trade was as lively as it had
been on any other morning.</p>

<p>The crowd bought rings and threw them recklessly
until each man had spent considerably more
than a dollar, when Teddy suddenly realized that
this sudden passion for canes only arose from a desire
to aid him. Then he said, decidedly:</p>

<p>"There's no need of you fellows doin' this. I
know you want to see me out of the scrape; but
I've made a lot of money already, an' don't want
to take yours."</p>

<p>"You can't have too much, my boy," one of them
said with a laugh, "and we want to see you go
away with a pile. Trade has been boomin' for all
hands, an' it would be kinder rough if we couldn't
have a little fun now the fair is the same as over."</p>

<p>This did not satisfy Teddy, and he continued to
expostulate against the generosity; but all to no
purpose. The fakirs played until a sufficient number
of visitors had arrived to warrant their opening
the other booths, and then Tim and Teddy were left
alone, Dan having started for the exhibition building
some time previous.</p>

<p>Until ten o'clock there was no more than work
enough to keep one boy moderately busy, and Teddy
experienced a deep sense of relief as Mr. Harvey
came up to the stand with a cheery "good morning."</p>

<p>"I hear that your Uncle Nathan succeeded in<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
carrying out his threat," the visitor said, as if
speaking about what was a very trifling matter.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; an' do you think he can send me to
prison?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. You are under bail, and I venture
to predict that he will not carry it to court, for
he has sufficient sense to know it may prove a very
expensive job. We sent our men to the barn on the
marshes last night."</p>

<p>"What did you find?" Teddy asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>"More than I expected. There were no goods in
the building, but some have evidently been buried
there, and this fact, together with the evidence that
boats have been drawn up on the shore recently,
proves your story as to what was seen when you
boys followed the two men to be correct."</p>

<p>"The other fellow has run away, I suppose."</p>

<p>"I think he is yet in the immediate vicinity,
otherwise Jim would be willing to talk."</p>

<p>"Have you seen him since he was arrested?"</p>

<p>"I have just come from the jail. I told him of the
evidence we already had to connect him with the
burglary, and that we should push him hard in the
interest of you and Hazelton. He understands that
there is an opportunity to turn State's witness, but
he absolutely refuses to speak on any subject.
Therefore I fancy his partner has not yet got away."</p>

<p>"Then there has been no good done in arresting
him," Teddy said, mournfully.<span class="pagenum">[256]</span></p>

<p>"That is where you are making a mistake. I have
prepared an affidavit for you and Dan to swear to,
and shall endeavor to have a warrant issued at
once charging him with burglary, so he can't give
us the slip in case he gets clear in the matter of
swindling."</p>

<p>"Do you want Dan an' I now?"</p>

<p>"Yes; go after him. I will only keep you ten or
fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>Teddy turned to go toward the exhibition buildings,
but halted an instant to ask:</p>

<p>"Have you seen my uncle this morning?"</p>

<p>"No, but I shall do so later in the day, and after
we have a little conversation I do not think he will
be so eager to see you in prison."</p>

<p>The lawyer's confident manner had very much to
do with taking the load of sorrow from Teddy's
mind, and he looked almost cheerful as he asked of
the manager of the Stevens exhibit that Dan be
allowed to accompany him, explaining the reason
for making the request.</p>

<p>"Of course he can go," the gentleman replied,
readily. "Trade won't be so good to-day but that
he can be spared as well as not, and even if it was
rushing, he should have permission to leave."</p>

<p>When the boys were at the cane-board once
more Mr. Harvey hurried them away to the magistrate's
office, and there a long document was read,
which described in detail all they had seen on the<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>
day when Sam first gave an exhibition of his skill
as a detective.</p>

<p>They marveled not a little that the lawyer should
have remembered so well every trifling incident.
Nothing, however apparently unimportant, had escaped
him, and, as Dan said:</p>

<p>"It is written down better than if he had really
been with us."</p>

<p>This document was sworn to and signed by both,
after which Mr. Harvey told them that they might
return to work, adding as he turned to Teddy:</p>

<p>"The man who has been arrested on your complaint
will have a hearing to-morrow, and it is absolutely
necessary you should be at this office as
early as nine o'clock. I don't know whether Dan
will be allowed to tell what he has heard Sam say
regarding the matter, but he had better come with
you."</p>

<p>"I'll be on hand," the young fakir replied. "Do
you know when I'm to be tried?"</p>

<p>"That case won't come up for some time in view
of the evidence your lawyer is collecting," the
'Squire said.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it, for I think the real burglars
will soon be caught."</p>

<p>"An' does Mr. Hazelton have to stay in jail all
the time?"</p>

<p>"There is no other way out of it, since he hasn't
got friends who can go bail for him."<span class="pagenum">[258]</span></p>

<p>Teddy wanted very much to ask permission to see
the prisoner, but inasmuch as he was accused of
being equally guilty with the fakir it hardly
seemed just the proper thing to make the request,
and he left the office, followed by Dan, who said, as
they gained the open air:</p>

<p>"You ain't goin' to have half so much trouble as
you think, Teddy. Anybody can see that even the
'Squire is on your side, although he did issue the
warrant, an' the proof must be mighty strong to
make any of 'em believe you did anything against
the old miser. But this keeps us here on the grounds
another day, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, an' if Mr. Sweet packs up his tent to-night,
we'll have to hunt for a place to sleep in the village."</p>

<p>"That don't worry me very much. I've made a
good week's work out of the fair, an' can afford to
spend a little money."</p>

<p>"I shall pay all the bills, of course," Teddy replied,
quickly. "It wouldn't be any more'n right
because you are goin' to stay to help me."</p>

<p>Dan was quite positive he would pay his own bills,
and his companion equally certain he should not;
but there was little chance for discussion, since
they had arrived opposite the grand stand by this
time, and were hailed by Deacon Jones, who looked
as if he considered himself the one important personage
on the grounds as he said:<span class="pagenum">[259]</span></p>

<p>"I want both of you boys to be here at exactly
two o'clock. Don't fail to come, no matter how
much business you may have on hand."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" Teddy asked, immediately
thinking some new trouble threatened him.</p>

<p>"There will be plenty of time for explanation
after you get here," was the mysterious reply, and
then the deacon signified that the interview was at
an end by turning to speak with some gentlemen
who had been watching the boys closely.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose is up now?" Teddy asked
with a sigh, and Dan replied, mournfully:</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," but in his own mind he
was convinced that the deacon intended to surrender
the boy whose surety he had appeared willing
to become on the evening previous.</p>

<p>Teddy was so disturbed by dismal forebodings
that Dan was very careful to hide his suspicions,
since it could do only harm to discuss them, and the
two parted, feeling as if Uncle Nathan had outwitted
Mr. Harvey.</p>

<p>On retuning to his place of business Teddy did
not have the heart to wait upon the customers, and
after telling Tim what had been said to him, he
added:</p>

<p>"I can't work; it's no use to try. There must
have been something new come up, an' I won't be
able to show that I'm innocent of robbing the
store."<span class="pagenum">[260]</span></p>

<p>Dan could give him no consolation, for he also
felt that matters were approaching a dangerous
crisis, and he simply said:</p>

<p>"Loaf around, old fellow, an' I'll look out for the
work here. Try to put it out of your mind, for
things won't be made better by worryin' over 'em."</p>

<p>Just at this moment Teddy's mother arrived. She
had heard all the particulars concerning the arrest
and subsequent release, therefore began at once to
sympathize with her son.</p>

<p>"Then you know what the deacon is goin' to do?"
Teddy asked.</p>

<p>This was something of which Mrs. Hargreaves
was ignorant, but upon being told, appeared even
more distressed than her son, thus increasing instead
of lightening his troubles.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>THE TESTIMONIAL.</i></p>

<p>It was impossible for Teddy to follow Tim's advice
to "loaf around."</p>

<p>His heart was so full of sorrow that his greatest
desire was to go where those who might believe he
had been a partner of the burglars could not see
him; but since that was impossible, if he intended
to obey the deacon's injunctions and present himself
at the grand stand at the specified time, the
next best thing was to remain behind the booth
where his mother tried her best to cheer him.</p>

<p>"It can't be possible that anything to your disadvantage
has occurred, Teddy," she said as she
held his hand for mutual sympathy. "Mr. Reaves
would have sent me word at once if that had happened."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he doesn't know about it. Uncle
Nathan may have been talking with the deacon
again, an' turned him against me."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it would be possible for him to
do such a thing. His reputation is not so good that<span class="pagenum">[262]</span>
people could put faith in all he says, more especially
in regard to this case."</p>

<p>"Then if he didn't do it some one else has, an'
that makes it all the worse," Teddy replied, as he
tried to force back the tears.</p>

<p>At this moment the sorrowing ones were startled
by hearing the voice of the man whom they had
every reason to call their enemy, and an instant
later Uncle Nathan stood before them.</p>

<p>"Well," he said in what sounded more like a
snarl than anything else, "you see the old skinflint
did jest what he promised, an' he'll see to it that
the deacon don't stay on your bail very long unless
I get my rights."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by your rights?" Mrs. Hargreaves
asked.</p>

<p>"I lent this ungrateful boy the money to start
him in a business where he's made more in a week
than I ever could in a year. Then he helped people
to rob me, an' after all that I made what any man
must call a fair offer. See how much I've lost by
him, an' then think of my offerin' to straighten
everything out by goin' in as his partner."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you do this before the fair opened?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't tell how it would turn out," the old
man began, and then realizing that he was admitting
something to his discredit, he added, quickly,
"I mean I hadn't lost my money then, an' never
suspected how he would wrong me."<span class="pagenum">[263]</span></p>

<p>It seemed as if these last words drove Teddy to
desperation, and he no longer-remembered the
respect due to age.</p>

<p>"Look here," he cried, angrily, rising, and standing
directly in front of Uncle Nathan, "if you believe
I'm a burglar, you can't want to be my
partner. It was only after the fact of my having
made considerable money was known that you
offered any trade. If the venture had been a losing
one you are the last person who would have taken
hold of it. Now I'm under arrest on a charge
made by you, who know I am innocent, an' we'll
put an end to all this talk. Don't come where my
mother and I am; do the very worst you can, an'
some day I'll have my innings."</p>

<p>"You threaten, eh?"</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I'm doing. I have leased
this piece of ground until to-morrow, and warn you
that it'll be mighty uncomfortable if you show your
nose here again. Go now an' go quick!"</p>

<p>"That's right, Teddy," Tim shouted in a tone of
delight from the opposite side of the booth. "Give
it to him hot, an' I'll do my share. If you don't
want to tackle the job till after the trial, say the
word an' I'll sail in, for it gives me a pain to see
him around."</p>

<p>Teddy made no reply to this generous offer; but
Uncle Nathan stepped back very quickly as if
fearing an immediate attack.<span class="pagenum">[264]</span></p>

<p>"You won't be so bold to-morrow," he snarled,
shaking his fist in impotent rage, and then he disappeared
from view amid the crowd that had begun
to gather.</p>

<p>Both Teddy and his clerk thought it very singular
that business should be so good on this day, when
the majority of the other fakirs were comparatively
idle, and also in view of what had been said against
the proprietor of the cane-board.</p>

<p>Yet the people gathered around by scores, all
intent on patronizing the boys, and at the same
time embracing every opportunity to display their
good will.</p>

<p>Teddy and his mother remained partially screened
from the gaze of the curious until nearly two
o'clock, when Dan, looking decidedly troubled,
arrived.</p>

<p>"I suppose we've got to go to the grand stand an'
find out what the deacon wants," he said, mournfully.
"My boss told me that we must be there on
time, an' we might as well start."</p>

<p>"I want to have it over as soon as possible,"
Teddy replied. "Nothin' that comes can be any
worse than waitin' here thinkin' of what may
happen."</p>

<p>The two boys walked either side of Mrs. Hargreaves
as they went to meet the deacon, and it
seemed very much as if the majority of the people
present knew what was about to occur, for the sad-visaged<span class="pagenum">[265]</span>
party was followed by crowds of the visitors
as they walked steadily onward.</p>

<p>It was exactly two o'clock when they arrived at
the stairway leading to the grand stand, and there
they were met by the leader of the band from the
Run, who said with a mysterious manner as he
opened a gate leading to the track in front of the
judges' stand:</p>

<p>"You are to come this way."</p>

<p>"Where's the deacon?" Teddy asked.</p>

<p>"Waiting for you."</p>

<p>Without further explanation the musician led the
three to a spot where all could see them, and to
the intense surprise of the sorrowful-looking party,
the throng assembled on the benches greeted them
with the most hearty applause.</p>

<p>"You are to come with me, Mrs. Hargreaves,"
the conductor said, as he escorted her to one of the
front seats, and Teddy and Dan stood as if stupefied,
gazing in dismay at the sea of faces in front
of them.</p>

<p>Before the boys had sufficiently recovered from
their bewilderment to be able to speculate upon
what was to happen Deacon Jones came down the
steps until he reached a place where all could see
him and there began a speech which caused at
least two of that assemblage to gaze at him in open-mouthed
astonishment.</p>

<p>The manager of the fair did not intend to neglect<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
any opportunity of making himself conspicuous,
and he delivered an eloquent address, looking first
at the boys and then at the audience, which cannot
be given here because of lack of space.</p>

<p>He first explained to the spectators that Teddy
had taken upon himself the business of fakir simply
that he might aid his widowed mother. Then he
detailed the loss of the fifteen dollars, and finally
broached the one important matter, that of the
scene on the creek, when the three women were
rescued from drowning.</p>

<p>By this time the cheeks of Teddy and Dan were
flaming red, and if he had been charging them with
the most atrocious crimes they could not have
looked more guilty or uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"As you all know," he said, in conclusion, "we
have met here to see bravery and a spirit of self-sacrifice
rewarded. On behalf of the ladies whose
lives were saved by these little heroes I am about to
present Edward Hargreaves and Daniel Summers
with one hundred dollars each. In addition to that
amount the managers of the fair and several gentlemen
who do not care to have their names made
public, have made up a purse of one hundred and
eighty dollars to be divided equally between them.
It is most gratifying to me that I have been selected
as the instrument through whom this testimonial
is presented, and in behalf of my brother officers as
well as myself I will state that these brave boys<span class="pagenum">[267]</span>
have the freedom of the grounds whenever the
Peach Bottom fair is open."</p>

<p>As he concluded, the deacon walked with a majestic
bearing down to the bewildered boys, presented
each with a well-filled pocketbook and then
waved his hand as a signal for the band, every
member of which did his best to make the music
heard above the rounds of applause intended for the
blushing fakirs.</p>

<p>In the meantime the people came down from the
benches to congratulate the life-savers, and for
fully an hour the two were forced to remain there
listening to words of praise which they felt were
not warranted by their exploit on the creek.</p>

<p>Among the most welcome of these enthusiastic
visitors was Jacob Sweet, and he said, heartily:</p>

<p>"I heard of this little performance jest in time to
get here before that long-winded speech was begun;
but what pleases me the most is that I was
ahead of the whole gang, an' started our little blow-out
when it wasn't known you had so many
friends. I'll see you to-night, of course, an' I must
go now, for the bouncer has been around tellin' that
you've been sleepin' in my tent, an' I count on a
good payin' crowd this afternoon."</p>

<p>It was considerably past three o'clock when the
boys and Mrs. Hargreaves returned to the cane-board,
looking very much different than when they
left it, and Tim cried as they came up:<span class="pagenum">[268]</span></p>

<p>"I've heard all about it, an' what I want to know
is, where was old Nathan while that speechifyin'
was goin' on?"</p>

<p>"I saw him when we first arrived," Mrs. Hargreaves
replied, "but he left a few moments later,
although I have no doubt that he remained where
he could hear all that was said without being seen."</p>

<p>"That's where he was wise. It wouldn't be very
pleasant for him to show himself now, 'cause everybody
is down on him after what the deacon said."</p>

<p>Dan was obliged to return to his duties, and he
whispered to Teddy before leaving:</p>

<p>"I tell you what it is, old feller, this has been a
reg'lar puddin' for us, an' I'd give a good deal to
see another jest like it."</p>

<p>"You're all right, but I expect after this Uncle
Nathan will be so mad he'll make me a pile of
trouble."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that; his claws are cut now.
I'll be back in time to go to supper."</p>

<p>When he departed Teddy had an opportunity to
say a few words to his mother before she returned
home on the stage, which was advertised to leave
at four o'clock, and while he did this all thought of
being under arrest was put far from his mind because
of the joy at what he was now able to perform.</p>

<p>"Never mind what happens to me," he whispered.
"I've now got nearly money enough to pay off all<span class="pagenum">[269]</span>
we owe, an' it has been earned honestly, too, although
I believe they paid a big price for what Dan
an' I did on the creek."</p>

<p>"I'm thinking more of the praise you earned than
the money, Teddy. It was very sweet to hear the
deacon say so much to you before all those people."</p>

<p>"Then both of us will be awfully jolly to-night,
an' to-morrow I'll be home, an' bring Dan with
me."</p>

<p>"Invite him to stay just as long as he wishes, and
I will have a nice supper ready when the last stage
arrives."</p>

<p>Teddy gave his mother nearly all the money he
had, including the "testimonial," and as she walked
away he said to Tim:</p>

<p>"I'm willin' to be arrested, an' put into jail a good
many days for the sake of being able to help her as
I can do now."</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[270]</span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>THE TRIAL.</i></p>

<p>It was only natural that both Teddy and Dan
should feel highly elated after this public expression
of admiration which culminated in the presentation
of the purse, but they immediately returned
to attend to their several duties when the ceremonies
were finished.</p>

<p>Dan went back to the exhibition as if he had done
nothing worth remembering, and in less than half
an hour from the time the deacon concluded his
flowery speech it would have required a very
ardent student of humanity to discover that anything
out of the natural course of events had taken
place.</p>

<p>At the cane-board Teddy waited upon his customers
as before, and without the slightest sign of
having been honored by the magnates of the fair,
while Dan fired at the target as if he had been a
boy with no other claim upon the public's attention
than his ability to hit a mark.</p>

<p>Yet it must be confessed that both experienced a
very pleasing sense of having satisfied the public,<span class="pagenum">[271]</span>
and each, in his own peculiar way, knew he had
risen a little above the average boy.</p>

<p>There can be no question that any one placed
in the same position must have felt gratified by the
many expressions of friendship and good-will with
which these two were literally overwhelmed, and it
would have been more than could be expected of
human nature had they remained unmoved under
the extravagant flattery which was showered upon
them immediately after the close of Deacon Jones'
speech.</p>

<p>Although there was not quite as much money
flowing into the box as on the day previous, Teddy
was more than pleased with the receipts, because
every penny seemed to express just such an amount
of good-will.</p>

<p>Until nearly nightfall he remained at the booth,
answering questions upon the same subject till it
seemed to have been worn threadbare, and then,
however great his desire to earn money, he felt a
positive sense of relief that his connection with the
Peach Bottom fair had finally come to an end.</p>

<p>"This is the last time you an' I will pack up the
stuff," he said to Tim as they put into condition for
removal the cane and knife boards. "I promised to
give you all that was left, and you're more than
welcome to it."</p>

<p>"But you surely don't mean to give me the whole
lot," Tim cried in surprise.<span class="pagenum">[272]</span></p>

<p>"That's exactly what I'm going to do, and I sincerely
hope when you make a stand you'll meet
with the same good friends I have here."</p>

<p>"I can't take these things unless you'll allow me
to pay something toward what they cost."</p>

<p>"Look here, Tim," Teddy said, earnestly, "you
have shown yourself to be a friend of mine, an'
every cent that has come in here you've accounted
for. Now, whatever may happen, I'm through bein'
a fakir; but if you want to follow the business, I
can only hope you'll come out all right. We'll carry
this to Mr. Sweet's tent, an' I'll only be so much
the better pleased, and in case you don't, I'm bound
to help you in every way. Besides, I promised to
pay a certain percentage on the profits; that is yet
to be settled."</p>

<p>"It never will be," Tim replied in the most decided
tone. "If I take these goods I've got more
than a fair share, an' won't listen to anything
else."</p>

<p>"Very well, we'll leave it that way. You now
own everything, an' I owe you lots of good-will."</p>

<p>On this basis the remnants of the two boards were
packed up for removal, and when they were about
to take the goods to Mr. Sweet's tent Dan arrived.</p>

<p>"How much business did you do to-day?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Teddy delayed sufficiently long to count the receipts,
and then replied:<span class="pagenum">[273]</span></p>

<p>"Forty-one dollars and fifteen cents. That gives
Tim four-eleven, an' I get more than would have
been the case but for the testimonial this afternoon.
The folks crowded around to see me, rather
than to get the canes, an' so business has picked up
better than any one expected."</p>

<p>"It don't make any difference how the money
came in so long as you have got it," Dan replied,
philosophically, "an' now the question is what are
we to do for supper, since we paid our bill at the
boarding-house this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Have you got any idea?"</p>

<p>"Of course, or else I wouldn't have asked the
question. Let's invite Mr. Sweet, the bouncer, and
the clown to some restaurant down town, an' try to
give them as good a time as we had last night."</p>

<p>This proposition met with Teddy's approval, and
the party was made up as he suggested, the cost
being divided between the two boys who had been
the recipients of the public testimonial.</p>

<p>Not until a late hour in the evening did these festivities
come to an end, and then the party retired
to the museum tent, where they remained undisturbed
until the present season of the Peach Bottom
fair had come to an end.</p>

<p>It was an unusually late hour for fakirs to arise
when Mr. Sweet awakened the boys as he said:</p>

<p>"Turn out now, lads, an' get your stuff ready for
removal. I'm sorry to part company, but we can't<span class="pagenum">[274]</span>
stay here forever, an' the museum must be forty
miles the other side of Waterville by Monday morning."</p>

<p>Dan had completed and been paid for his work
with the Stevens Company, therefore he had nothing
to do; Teddy no longer claimed any interest in
the canes and knives left over from the week's
work; consequently he was free to go where he
pleased, and Tim had his goods in such a condition
that they could be removed at any moment, which
prevented him from feeling any anxiety regarding
the future.</p>

<p>Thus it was that all three of the boys were at liberty
to assist the proprietor of the museum, and
this they did with a will until the arrival of Lawyer
Harvey caused them to think of what had almost
been forgotten in the bustle and confusion of breaking
camp.</p>

<p>"We are due at the 'Squire's office at nine o'clock,
and it is time you boys were getting over that way,"
he said, briskly; "our case won't come up to-day,
but it has been decided to give Hazelton a hearing,
and I am very much afraid he's going to get the
worst of it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Teddy asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Well, you see I have not been able to get any information
in addition to what you boys furnished,
and there seems little doubt that the 'Squire
must perforce bind him over for trial. The fact<span class="pagenum">[275]</span>
that he has deliberately swindled so many people
will work against him, and we can do very little to
save him."</p>

<p>"What will be the result of his being bound
over?" Teddy asked.</p>

<p>"He must remain in jail, unless he can get bail,
until next fall."</p>

<p>"But that in itself will be a terrible punishment."</p>

<p>"True; yet it cannot be avoided. If he had
worked honestly the case would be different; but
now he will be fortunate even to get out in the fall."</p>

<p>"Yet Uncle Nathan says I am equally guilty."</p>

<p>"We can easily show you had nothing to do with
the robbery, and that is our only care this morning."</p>

<p>"What about Long Jim?"</p>

<p>"He remains silent, refusing to answer the simplest
questions, and unless he speaks Hazelton
must be bound over; the 'Squire can pursue no other
course."</p>

<p>Believing as they did that Hazelton was innocent
of the charge upon which he had been arrested,
both Teddy and Dan felt it was a great hardship
for the fakir to remain so long in prison; but since
it was beyond their power to give him any relief,
neither expressed an opinion other than has been
recorded.</p>

<p>Mr. Harvey had come for them to accompany
him to the Squire's office, and since there was nothing<span class="pagenum">[276]</span>
to detain them they set out, after first bidding
Mr. Sweet a cordial 'goodby, for he had announced
his intention of leaving Peach Bottom on
the noon train.</p>

<p>"I shall see one or both of you at some time in the
future," he said, with considerable feeling, "an'
there'll be no complaint to make if I never fall in
with worse boys."</p>

<p>The bouncer and the clown also had something to
say in the form of an adieu, and when the boys left
the proprietor of the alleged wonderful museum it
was like parting with an old friend, for he had
shown himself to be a "very present help in time
of trouble."</p>

<p>Tim did not propose to start for the Run until his
companions had concluded their business; his goods
were packed ready for removal, and there was
nothing better for him to do than accompany them
to the court-room where it seemed as if all they might
say would result only in a long term of imprisonment
for Hazelton before he could be tried on the
baseless charge brought against him, simply because
of the disreputable business in which he was
engaged.</p>

<p>Mr. Harvey had little or nothing to say during
the walk to the 'Squire's office, and arriving there
the jewelry fakir was seen looking thoroughly despondent.</p>

<p>"Can I speak with him?" Teddy asked the lawyer.<span class="pagenum">[277]</span>
"What do you want to say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing in particular, except to tell him how
bad I feel because we could do nothing to clear
him."</p>

<p>"Very well; but do not talk long, for it may prejudice
your own case. The people whom he has
swindled are here to see that some form of punishment
is meted out to him, and it can do you no good
to be seen acting as a consoler."</p>

<p>This possibility troubled Teddy very little since
he was confident of his own innocence, and he approached
the prisoner as he said:</p>

<p>"I wish I could do something, Mr. Hazelton, to
prove you as innocent as I believe you to be."</p>

<p>"There's no need of that, my boy. I've put you in
a hole already, and you've done more for me than
some others who call themselves friends."</p>

<p>"I know it was Long Jim who committed the
burglary; but how can it be proven now?"</p>

<p>"There was only one way, and that was to catch
the real thieves with their plunder. Mr. Harvey
tells me his attempt was a failure, an' it wouldn't
surprise me if I was not only remanded for trial,
but received a sentence for something of which I
am absolutely innocent. I don't profess to be very
good, my boy, as you may understand after seeing
me work on the fair grounds; but I never yet descended
to do such things as I am charged with
now."<span class="pagenum">[278]</span></p>

<p>"I am certain of that," and Teddy pressed the
prisoner's hand in token of friendship, "and only
wish it was possible to aid you."</p>

<p>"You have already done more than my partners
did," was the grateful reply, and then further conversation
was prevented as the 'Squire called the
assembly to order.</p>

<p>It was not a regular court of law; but one would
have thought it the most dignified judicial body in
the country had he seen the air with which the
'Squire took his seat at the head of the long table
as he called the case.</p>

<p>"That settles Hazelton," Dan whispered as Teddy
left the prisoner and rejoined his friends. "Somebody
has got to suffer in order to make the law
come out square, an' he's the feller what'll have to
stand the brunt of everything."</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>AN ARRIVAL.</i></p>

<p>Lawyer Harvey did not neglect anything
which might work to the advantage of his
client; but in the face of the evidence his efforts
appeared to be in vain.</p>

<p>Uncle Nathan, who arrived just as the case was
called, swore to the fact that Hazelton had been in
his store on the Sunday afternoon prior to the robbery,
and that he had told the prisoner of his keeping
large amounts of money in the building, because
of the difficulty and expense of sending the
cash to the Waterville bank.</p>

<p>He also testified that Hazelton seemed unusually
interested in everything pertaining to the store, and
asked many questions relative to his (the witness')
habits, such as the time when business usually began,
how late he remained in the building at night,
as well as several other things which now seemed
as if the information had been sought simply for
the purpose of knowing when would be the safest
time to commit the crime.</p>

<p>"How much did you lose?" Mr. Harvey asked.<span class="pagenum">[280]</span></p>

<p>"I don't know for certain; but I stand willin' to
give fifty dollars if the goods can be recovered, an'
if my nephew would tell all he knows&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That will do, Mr. Hargreaves," the lawyer said,
sharply. "Teddy is not under examination, and
until he is we do not care to hear your opinion concerning
him."</p>

<p>"I reckon I can tell what I want to, can't I,
'Squire?"</p>

<p>"You must confine yourself to this particular
case. As to whether there is sufficient evidence to
bind the prisoner over does not concern the charge
against your nephew, at least not to the extent of
your telling what you think."</p>

<p>"I thought, perhaps, if he heard me say I'd give
fifty dollars to know where the goods were, an'
knew I'd swear to it, he might confess, for he has
shown himself to be powerful fond of a dollar."</p>

<p>"That appears to be a peculiarity of some of his
relatives," Mr. Harvey said, dryly, and at this remark
the spectators laughed heartily, while the old
man growled:</p>

<p>"I didn't come here to be told that I was a miser;
but it seems even men who call themselves gentlemen
think sich things are all right."</p>

<p>"If you have no other evidence to give we will
not detain you," the lawyer said, sharply; and as
Uncle Nathan returned to his chair near the door<span class="pagenum">[281]</span>
the proprietor of the hotel at the Run was called
upon to testify.</p>

<p>What he said was in favor of the prisoner rather
than otherwise.</p>

<p>He swore to the fact that the prisoner spent the
night on which the burglary was committed at his
house; that he pretended to retire at an early hour,
and started for Peach Bottom on the first stage.</p>

<p>Under Mr. Harvey's skillful cross-examination
the landlord admitted that unless a man got out of
the window he could not have left the house without
the knowledge of the watchman, who kept the
keys and remained in the office all night. It was
also shown that Hazelton brought and carried away
with him, so far as was known at the hotel, nothing
but a small traveling satchel.</p>

<p>Then several people from the Run were called to
prove that the fakir was really in the town on this
particular Sunday, and the driver of the stage testified
that the prisoner rode with him the entire distance
to Peach Bottom. The landlord of the hotel
where Hazelton boarded during the fair week, or so
much of it as he was at liberty, swore to the fact
that the prisoner had never brought any quantity of
baggage to his house, and appeared to be very regular
in his habits. So far as he (the landlord) knew,
the fakir remained in his room nearly all the time,
except while on the exhibition grounds.</p>

<p>This ended the testimony, and Mr. Harvey argued<span class="pagenum">[282]</span>
that there was really no evidence to connect the
prisoner with the crime.</p>

<p>"That he conducted a game which could hardly
be called honest is admitted," he said; "but it has
nothing to do with the case. Prejudice should not
be allowed to take the place of facts, and I insist
that my client be released."</p>

<p>"I reckon there's sufficient ground for suspicion,"
the 'Squire replied, "an' I don't see any other way
out of it. A jury must decide, an' I shall hold him
in the sum of three thousand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment the dignity of the court received
a severe shock, as a most unseemly disturbance suddenly
occurred at the door, and the 'Squire paused to
learn who was so bold as to disturb the representative
of the law at the very instant when he was delivering
an opinion.</p>

<p>"It's nobody but a boy," Uncle Nathan replied as
he held the door firmly closed, while the would-be
visitor kicked so vigorously as to threaten the destruction
of the panels.</p>

<p>"Bring him in here, an' we'll see whether such a
row can be kicked up in a court of law with impunity."</p>

<p>"Better let me throw him into the street," Uncle
Nathan snarled.</p>

<p>"Mr. Constable, bring that boy before me," the
'Squire said, sternly, and an instant later, to the
consternation of all those who had seen him, the<span class="pagenum">[283]</span>
boy who was supposed to have been drowned two
days before entered, looking decidedly the worse
for having existed so long without water and soap.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Sam, an' he ain't dead!" Teddy cried
as he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Of course I ain't; but it wouldn't been many
days before I turned into a corpse if I hadn't got
away from them thieves," the amateur detective replied.</p>

<p>"Who are you, an' what do you want here?" the
'Squire asked, sternly, as he rapped on the table for
the spectators to remain silent.</p>

<p>"Why, I'm Sam Balderston, the feller who come
to the fair to work for the Davis Boat an' Oar Company
of Detroit, an' if what Long Jim told me was
true, folks have been tryin' to find me in the
creek."</p>

<p>"This is the boy who was reported to have been
drowned on the day when those lads," here the lawyer
pointed to Teddy and Dan, "claim to have seen
two men carrying goods into an old barn on the
marshes. I fancy he can give us information relative
to the true burglars."</p>

<p>"You bet I can," and now that he was the central
figure in the scene, all Sam's old assurance returned.
"If you mean the fellers what broke into
Teddy's uncle's store, I can flash one of them up.
The other come to the fair an' didn't get back, so
Phil thought he was arrested."<span class="pagenum">[284]</span></p>

<p>"Who do you mean by the other fellow?" Mr.
Harvey asked.</p>

<p>"Why, Long Jim, the same man what swindled
Teddy out of his fifteen dollars at Waterville."</p>

<p>"Have you been with him since your disappearance?"</p>

<p>"Most of the time he hung around, an' then ag'in
Phil was there."</p>

<p>"Who is Phil?"</p>

<p>"Long Jim's partner. They've got a slat of stuff
what has been stole 'round here, an' I know where
all of it is."</p>

<p>"Tell the 'Squire the whole story."</p>

<p>This was Sam's opportunity, and, in order to cover
himself with glory, he slaughtered the truth in the
most shocking manner.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, in a consequential way, "when
Dan an' me an' Teddy saw the thieves carryin' stuff
down to that old barn I wanted to rush in an' arrest
both; but the other fellows was scared an'
come ashore to talk with Hazelton so's he'd tell 'em
what to do. Then I jes' made up my mind to carry
on the job myself, an' went back."</p>

<p>"Where?" the 'Squire asked.</p>

<p>"To the barn to get the stuff. While I was diggin'
it up the men come back, an' the minute they saw
who was on their trail they got frightened."</p>

<p>"And who was on their trail?" the 'Squire interrupted.<span class="pagenum">[285]</span></p>

<p>"Why, me, of course. They rushed in, an' I had
the awfullest row; but it was two to one, an' so I
got the worst of it. They had to work mighty hard
before gettin' me tired, an' then all the stuff was
dug up an' put in the boat. My craft was upset an'
sent adrift, so's to make it look as if I was dead, an'
we went down the creek six or seven miles, where
we hid in the woods. Phil came back here after
more goods what had been stolen, an' they was goin'
to skip the country, when there was a big row,
an' Long Jim allowed he'd come to the fair once
more. Phil was mad, an' got pretty drunk, an'
after that I had my innings. I turned to an' lashed
him up same's I'd been; but we had an' awful fight.
It takes more'n one man to git away with me."</p>

<p>"Where is this fellow now?" the 'Squire interrupted
again.</p>

<p>"Down the creek, tied up so's he can't hardly
breathe, an' he must be pretty near sober by this
time."</p>

<p>"If he was very drunk I do not understand how
he could have fought so hard."</p>

<p>"Well, he did; but I got the best of him, an'
what's more, I know where all the stuff that's been
stolen is hid."</p>

<p>"Mr. Constable, bring into court the prisoner who
is charged with swindling, and let us see if this extraordinary
boy can identify him," the 'Squire said,
with an unusual amount of dignity.<span class="pagenum">[286]</span></p>

<p>"If it's Long Jim, you bet I can," Sam said, as he
turned toward the spectators that they might have
a good opportunity of seeing such a wonderful detective
as he claimed to be.</p>

<p>Teddy and Dan could hardly control their impatience
to speak privately with Sam. As a matter of
course, they understood that he was embellishing
the story, and both were eager to make him tell the
exact truth.</p>

<p>Just at that moment, however, Sam had no time
to spend on ordinary boys. He had come out of a
bad scrape with apparently flying colors, and intended
to enjoy his triumph to the utmost before
sinking back to his rightful plane.</p>

<p>The jail was near at hand, and Sam had not exhibited
himself as much as he desired when Long
Jim was brought in.</p>

<p>On seeing the boy the burglar gave a start of surprise,
and allowed the incriminating question to escape
his lips:</p>

<p>"Has Phil been pinched, too?"</p>

<p>"I took care of that business, an' we'll bring him
in some time to-day. Say, what about that awful
lickin' you was goin' to give me?"</p>

<p>"I'll cut your throat before this job is finished,"
was the angry reply, and there was no longer any
necessity of asking Sam if he recognized the prisoner.</p>

<p>"You say you can show us the stolen goods, and<span class="pagenum">[287]</span>
the other burglar is where the officers can get him?"
Mr. Harvey asked.</p>

<p>"That's just what I can do," Sam replied, proudly.</p>

<p>"Then you will have earned fifty dollars, for Mr.
Hargreaves has promised, even sworn, that he will
pay that amount for the return of his property,"
Mr. Harvey continued.</p>

<p>"He might as well give me the money now, for
I'm ready to turn the stuff up, an' when there's
more big detective work to be done, come to me."</p>

<p>"I don't know about payin' any reward till I'm
certain the little villain isn't one of the thieves himself,
an' is doin' this to swindle me," Uncle Nathan
cried, quickly.</p>

<p>"He shall have the reward if the story is true,"
the 'Squire replied. "You can't go back on what
you've sworn to, an' must pay up. Mr. Constable,
get two or three men an' go with this boy. Don't
lose sight of him for a minute until he has given all
the information in his power."</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[288]</span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>IN CONCLUSION.</i></p>

<p>Sam was led away before either Teddy or Dan
could speak privately with him; but they went
at once to congratulate Hazelton on his apparently
happy escape, and, in response to Mr. Harvey's request,
the 'Squire said:</p>

<p>"The prisoner can remain here, or in your custody,
until the party returns. If the boy has told
the truth there is nothing for me to do but discharge
him, and I am really glad that he has come out so
fortunately."</p>

<p>"Don't think I'll ever forget what you've done for
me," Hazelton whispered to Teddy.</p>

<p>"But it isn't me at all. Sam seems to have fixed
everything."</p>

<p>"I've got an idea that I know pretty near the
truth of the whole story, never mind how he tells
it. At all events, we've no reason to complain, for
if the goods and the other burglar are found, we
are out of our trouble. Your uncle's charges can't
hold after that."</p>

<p>It was, as Teddy now realized for the first time, a<span class="pagenum">[289]</span>
happy conclusion to the troubles of both, and his
heart was lighter than it had been at any time since
the accusation was made.</p>

<p>There was no question that those who had gone
with Sam would be absent several hours, and
the little party in the court-room had more time at
their disposal than could well be occupied by the
discussion of their affairs.</p>

<p>After the different phases of the case had been
gone over in detail, Hazelton asked Teddy:</p>

<p>"How did you come out at the fair?"</p>

<p>"I haven't figured up; but I know I've made a
good deal, an' it must be almost enough, countin'
the money Deacon Jones gave us, to pay the debt
on the place."</p>

<p>Until this moment Teddy had had so much on his
mind that the principal cause of his turning fakir
was absent from his mind; but now, with nothing
better to do, he began to count up the week's work,
announcing the result a few moments later by saying:</p>

<p>"I took in two hundred an' fifty-two dollars an'
fifty cents during the week. Out of that must come
the money I lost at Waterville, what I paid Uncle
Nathan, the privilege, the money I paid Mr. Reaves
for the stock, Tim's wages, an' my board. That
leaves one hundred an' forty-five dollars an' ninety-eight
cents. With what came in from the testimonial
I'll have enough to pay off the debt on the house,<span class="pagenum">[290]</span>
an' pretty near eight dollars for myself, which is
what I call a big week's work."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you have made it," Hazelton replied,
heartily. "There is a little matter between you an'
I which yet remains to be settled, and when that
has been done you should be considerably better
off."</p>

<p>"I don't want you to do a thing," Teddy said,
quickly. "So many people have helped me since
the fair opened that it seems as if I was nothing
more or less than a beggar."</p>

<p>"You come very far from deserving that title,"
the fakir replied, and then the entrance of Mr.
Reaves interrupted the conversation. After talking
with the lawyer, the merchant said to Teddy:</p>

<p>"I am more than pleased to learn that you will be
freed from all your troubles in a short time. Next
week I shall be in need of a clerk, and if you wish
to take the situation it shall be left open until you
are ready to go to work. The wages are six dollars
a week for the first year, with an increase as soon
as you can earn it, and I will really be pleased to
have you in my employ."</p>

<p>"I'd like to come," Teddy replied; "but it don't
seem just right to leave mother."</p>

<p>"There is no necessity of doing so. You can ride
back and forth on the stage, unless your mother
should decide, as I think she will eventually, to
make her home in Waterville."<span class="pagenum">[291]</span></p>

<p>"If she approves of the plan I'll come to work
next week."</p>

<p>"Make it two weeks, so that there'll be plenty of
time to arrange matters, and I will expect you," the
merchant replied in a tone which showed that he
was more than satisfied with the arrangement. "I
only came over to see if you needed any assistance;
but Mr. Harvey says you'll soon be free from the
charge your uncle made, therefore I will go back
at once."</p>

<p>About an hour after the merchant departed Sam
and the constables returned with Phil and the stolen
goods.</p>

<p>The amateur detective was in the best possible
spirits, and now that the burglar had been apprehended
through his assistance the boy felt absolutely
certain he was the greatest detective in the
country.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, there was nothing the
'Squire could do save discharge Hazelton from custody,
and after Mr. Harvey had given his word that
he would take care Sam should appear when wanted
as a witness, the boy rejoined his friends, saying as
he did so:</p>

<p>"If you fellers had done as I wanted you'd be way
up now, the same as I am. Of course, I don't blame
you for being afraid; but when you go out on such
work the only way is to hold on."</p>

<p>"I wonder how long you'd have held on if the<span class="pagenum">[292]</span>
men hadn't made you stay with them?" Dan asked.</p>

<p>"Who told you that?" Sam said. "If I staid, it
was because I knowed it wouldn't be long until I
got the upper hand of the gang, an I've done it."</p>

<p>Before the party separated, and while Uncle
Nathan was identifying the goods which had been
stolen from him, Mr. Harvey insisted that the reward
should be paid, and although it was very much
like drawing a tooth, the old man was finally induced
to make his word good.</p>

<p>"It's a pile of money, but I earned it," Sam said,
as he tucked Uncle Nathan's grudgingly bestowed
cash in his trousers pocket. "There ain't many
'round this part of the country who could have done
what I did, an' it's only right detectives should be
well paid."</p>

<p>Then, with many protestations of friendship, the
lawyer started for home, after returning to Hazelton
the money which Teddy had given Mr. Reaves
for safekeeping, and the fakir said as he walked
out of the court-room with the four boys:</p>

<p>"Now, I want you to come with me, until my business
is settled, and then I'll shake the dust of
Peach Bottom from my feet in the shortest possible
time."</p>

<p>Not understanding what he meant, the boys accompanied
him to the nearest jewelry store, and
there he bought two silver watches, which he presented
to Teddy and Dan, as he said:<span class="pagenum">[293]</span></p>

<p>"These are only to remind you that I am grateful
for what has been done. It isn't much of a present;
but it will suffice to show I'm not ungrateful. Some
time in the future I may meet you again, and then
the full debt shall be paid if I'm solid enough to do
it."</p>

<p>He was gone almost before the astonished boys
could thank him, and with his departure this story
should properly be concluded, since Teddy has
made his last appearance as a fakir.</p>

<p>A few more words, and "the end" shall be written.</p>

<p>Sam, still believing himself especially designed
for a detective, is yet displaying his "style" as an
oarsman in the employ of the Davis Boat and Oar
Company, and he believes he has guessed the
weight of the yacht which is so soon to be given
away.</p>

<p>Dan accepted an offer from Mr. Reaves last week,
and he and Teddy are learning the same business,
both looking forward to the time when they shall
own a store equally as large.</p>

<p>Uncle Nathan is still at the Run, but his trade has
decreased very materially, and Hazelton has not
been seen since the day he left Peach Bottom; but
it is quite possible that when the fair opens this season
all the fakirs may again meet the country boy
who made such a successful venture at the country
fair.</p>

If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
